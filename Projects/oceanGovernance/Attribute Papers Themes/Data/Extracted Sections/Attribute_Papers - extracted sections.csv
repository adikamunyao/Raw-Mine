 Environment- The Path of Global Environmental Governance – Form and Function in Historical Perspective.pdf,"After revisiting the concept of accountability in national governance, this paper analyzes the challenges of its application
to international governance, including an assessment of some of the modalities it has assumed. It then proposes a bot-
tom-up multilayered and multistakeholder accountability framework for the 2030 Development Agenda: national follow-up
processes at the base of the pyramid, consultations and possibly peer reviews at the regional level, a global accountabil-
ity system led by the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) and supported by the ECOSOC system, United Nations and other
international organizations, and active participation by civil society and the private sector with their own accountability
frameworks in place.",,,,Research Paper
 INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (IGOS) AND THEIR ROLES AND ACTIVITIES IN SECURITY ECONOMY HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT_E_ref.pdf,"This journal explores the evolution, roles, and activities of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) within the realms of security, economy, health, and environment. It highlights the transformative role of IGOs in addressing globalization-driven challenges that transcend state boundaries, such as international trade, climate change, public health crises, and security threats. The study analyzes data from the Union of International Associations (UIA) and reveals that economic activities dominate the focus of IGOs, followed by environmental issues, security, and health. Examples of key IGOs, such as the United Nations, NATO, WHO, and WTO, illustrate how these organizations address specific global challenges while adapting to changing political, economic, and technological landscapes. The conclusion emphasizes the growing importance of IGOs as indispensable actors in fostering global cooperation and governance, despite ongoing challenges of accountability, resource limitations, and the need for coherence across their multifaceted activities.",,,,Review
“Privatisation_’ in the United Nations system_.pdf,"This journal examines the growing influence of privatization within the United Nations system, analyzing how private sector interests have increasingly shaped the functions of certain UN intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). Focusing on three case studies—the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO)—it illustrates how private companies have influenced regulatory frameworks, development agendas, and policy implementation. The study critiques the neoliberal shift where private profit-driven entities gain power in traditionally public domains, questioning the democratic integrity of such arrangements. It concludes by highlighting the complex dynamics between public and private interests within the UN, emphasizing the need for balance to prevent private influence from undermining the system's intended multilateral and public-oriented goals.",,,,Review
A Changing United Nations_Multilateral Evolution and the Quest for Global Governance.pdf,"Intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) help to create and bind international regimes. Without them,
there would be little in the way of monitoring performance, devising regulations, considering sanctions
and arranging follow-up meetings. Yet they are all too often relatively shadowy bodies with little accountability
or even institutional identity. The illuminating article by  Biermann and Bauer that follows, suggests some novel
ways in which to evaluate their performance and effectiveness in international environmental regimes.
The trick is to guess what would have occurred without  their existence. They do mobilise agendas, establish
rules, generate responsiveness, possibly change national  reporting styles, and activate stakeholders. But they are
also creatures of international diplomatic politics. They therefore fall prey to the personalities and the prejudices
of the diplomats, advisors, lobbyists, and various hangers-on. Such personalities and advocacy politics
are usually very difﬁcult to fathom, unless the analyst works from the inside. Here is an opportunity for the
scientist-cum-journalist-cum-intelligence gatherer. Such people are becoming part of the academic scene. But
deeper still are the national politics that lurk behind the intergovernmental diplomats. They lie in the realms of
more established politics and political analysis. Combine the two perspectives and the IGOs may get a fair and
reasonable assessment.","In analysing international environmental co-operation, most studies have focused on states as actors of international relations (IR) and on international institutions as constraints that place limits on state action. Scholars have also reached beyond the traditional focus of interstate relations and have examined the role of non-state actors and of public–private partnerships. Intergovernmental organisations, however, have largely stayed outside the mainstream debate in IR discourse. Apart from a small literature of descriptive and taxonomic studies that are informed by  international law, diplomatic history and the accounts of practi- tioners, few scholars have yet attempted to systematically examine the effectiveness of international organisations as actors in their own right.This gap in the literature is problematic for several reasons. First, the limited understanding of the effectiveness of international organisations is likely to mislead conclusions about the state of global environmental governance, resulting in an overemphasis on state power and on a perception of international institutions as mere structures devised by states with no role of other actors such as intergovernmental organisations. Improved scholarly understanding of the effectiveness of international organisations will also help to resolve ongoing policy debates about the reform of the United Nations system. In the ﬁeld of international environmental governance, the ‘‘effectiveness’’ of the UN and its specialised agencies has been subject of intense public debate, with little academic response from the community of IR scholars. One example is the recent debate on the creation of a world environment organisation, which could proﬁt from a more solid academic grounding in IR research. As politicians and practitioners debate organisational reform, academics remain unable to specify how international organisations effect the outcomes and impacts of global environmental governance. Subsequently, reliable answers on how their effectiveness may be increased, derived from a substantive and systematic research effort, are not available. In the following, we criticise the current global governance discourse based on its lack of attention for intergovernmental organisations, and sketch a research strategy for assessing the effectiveness of intergovernmental organisations in the ﬁeld of international environmental politics.",,,Research Paper
A typology of board design for highly effective monitoring in intergovernmental_Federo.pdf,"The United Nations (UN) system comprises several intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) that were established to contrib-
ute to the functioning of the overall transnational system of delivering global public goods. However, many IGOs under the
UN system are criticized for their failure to accomplish their mandates. Research argues that IGO boards serve as a gover-
nance mechanism that should be designed in order to effectively perform the monitoring function to ensure fulﬁllment of
IGO mandates. Thus, using an inductive fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, this study explores 13 IGO boards under
the UN system to identify the board designs that are associated with highly effective monitoring. Our ﬁndings reveal a board
design typology reﬂecting the interplay of the level of organizational complexity and the extent of the distribution problem in
IGOs. This research contributes to our understanding of IGO governance by underscoring the relationship between board
designs and highly effective monitoring to help researchers and practitioners improve IGO performance.",,"In conclusion, understanding how to monitor the UN system is important because its IGOs have an extensive
impact upon a wide array of stakeholders spanning transnational borders. The UN system governs the institu-
tional arrangements responsible for policymaking where different organizations and actors operate and interact
with each other (e.g. Shaffer 2015). Monitoring is crucial to help ensure that IGOs perform according to the man-
dates vested by the member states that created them. As we explored IGO board designs, we found that there
seems to be no one-size-ﬁts-all approach to IGO governance. There are multiple ways to achieve highly effective
monitoring. However, there are also multiple ways that can go wrong in governance design choices. Ultimately,
IGO governance designs should address governance constraints to mitigate barriers that could inhibit the effec-
tive functioning of the organization.","board design, governance, intergovernmental organization, monitoring, qualitative comparative analysis.",Research Paper
A World Environment Organization_Solution.pdf,,"Document T1 Summary:
The introduction of the book ""A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?"" sets the stage for a comprehensive analysis of global environmental governance, particularly in the context of UN reform debates. Lorraine Elliott's contribution highlights the persistent challenges in international environmental governance, emphasizing the lack of a well-resourced UN agency with overarching responsibility for environmental issues and the ongoing tensions between developed and developing nations. Joyeeta Gupta further explores the implications of these governance structures for developing countries, stressing the need for proactive negotiation strategies to avoid marginalization. The book ultimately underscores the complexity of achieving effective environmental governance amidst competing national interests and the necessity for realistic expectations regarding the UN's role in this arena.

Document T2 Summary:
In the second part of the book, various contributions present arguments for and against the establishment of a World Environment Organization (WEO). Steve Charnovitz advocates for a robust global environmental governance framework akin to the World Trade Organization, arguing that the environment has been overshadowed by development issues over time. Conversely, Frank Biermann suggests upgrading the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to enhance coordination and support for developing countries. Other contributors, like Sebastian Oberthür and Thomas Gehring, caution against creating a WEO, arguing that it could divert resources from existing institutions, while Adil Najam emphasizes the need to strengthen UNEP rather than pursue new organizational structures. The discussions reflect a spectrum of opinions on how best to address the challenges of global environmental governance.

Document T3 Summary:
The review of ""A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?"" highlights the book's timely contribution to the ongoing debate about global environmental governance, which has been discussed for over three decades. The editors, Frank Biermann and Steffen Bauer, provide a structured overview of the arguments for and against a WEO, presenting various models for enhancing environmental governance. The review notes that while there is no consensus on the establishment of a WEO, there is a shared recognition of the need to strengthen UNEP and improve international cooperation. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of further research into the institutional relationships between environmental protection and sustainable development, as well as the necessity for social sciences to engage more deeply with the dynamics of intergovernmental organizations in global governance discussions.",,,Unidentified
Accountability in International Governance and the 2030 Development Agenda.pdf,"The debate on a World Environment Organization (WEO) started some 30 years ago. It has been
conducted by diplomats, politicians, political scientists, international lawyers and journalists in a scattered manner in fora such as diplo-
matic and academic conferences,peer-reviewed journals and news-papers. However, it seems that so far, no comprehensive book has been
published on this issue. The book A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental

An Unfinished Foundation_The United Nations and Global Environmental Governance_Ken Conca.pdf,"Environmental management has emerged as an important element of governance in practically every nation. This was not the case before the
United Nations (""UN"") convened the 1972 Conference on the Human Environment (""Stockholm"") in Stockholm. After Stockholm, nations learned
to build environmental ministries and work across sectors nationally, and discovered how difficult it is to reshape entrenched national practices in order
to curb pollution and conserve natural resources. With growing experience and knowledge, nations came to realize that no one government alone could
safeguard the environment, and that international cooperation would need to be enhanced. Twenty years after Stockholm, nations had developed their capacity
to assess environmental conditions and realized that environmental conditions were deteriorating more extensively than had earlier been
understood. As a result, in 1992 the United Nations convened the UN Conference on Environment and Development (""UNCED"") in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite UNCED's extensive recommendations' and the oversight of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (""UNCSD""), established to follow
up on those recommendations, 2 momentum to organize the international community to cope with environmental problems subsequent to Rio flagged.'
In order to refocus international efforts to advance environmental governance,in 2002 the United Nations General Assembly convened the World Summit
on Sustainable Development (""WSSD"") in Johannesburg. 4 Improvement in the system of international environmental governance was one of the priority
themes assigned to the WSSD. Despite the widely acknowledged understanding that environmental conditions worldwide have deteriorated since UNCED in 1992,' the WSSD
failed to respond in any significant new way to these challenges.' Although the nations gathered in Johannesburg made modest progress in addressing the
need to encourage sustainable energy systems and achieved some consensus that the supply of potable water and sewage treatment must be a global
priority, 7 they could do little to make new policies. 8 The WS SD nations made no decisions addressing the improvement of international institutional
systems for managing environmental problems. This reluctance to strengthen the systems for enhancing international environmental governance constituted
a retreat from the consensus that strengthening governance was a goal of the WSSD. 9 The WSSD simply reaffirmed the governance systems already in
place as of 1992 and urged the existing bodies to do their jobs more effectively. "" Why did the issue of international environmental governance stall at
the WSSD, and whither will these issues now tend? It may be premature to hazard answers to these queries, but answers must be sought because many
of earth's natural systems-upon which human well-being depends-are eroding faster than solutions are being established to sustain them.",,,,Reviews
Assessing the effectiveness of intergovernmental organisations in international environmental politics.pdf,"Our world is getting smaller. Political and economic liberalization, together with sweeping technological change, have made all of
humanity more interdependent. New and exciting opportunities are emerging, as are new risks and new challenges. Undoubtedly,
globalization has emerged as the key governance challenge for the 2Ist century, and making globalization sustainable will require
creative new forms of cooperation by all sectors of our society. This report is a major contribution to the ongoing debate on
globalization and governance. It goes beyond the merely theoretical by presenting one practical and promising avenue to address gover-
nance challenges: global public-policy (GPP) networks. In these networks, states, international organizations, civil society, and the
corporate sector collaborate to make globalization work for all. Over its 30-year history, Canada's International Development
Research Centre (IDRC) has helped to establish many such networks. IDRC's experience in facilitating, through research and policy net-
works, South—South and South—North collaboration truly exhibits that the sum is often greater that its constituent parts. Take, for
example, the Crucible Group. Supported by IDRC, the Canadian International Development Agency, and a number of other inter-
national organizations, the Group includes members from private industry, government, advocacy groups, and aboriginal groups.
Since 1993 it has provided a forum for serious debate and policy recommendations on intellectual property rights, biodiversity, and
food security. Building on existing knowledge, the authors of Critical Choices explore both the promise and the limits of GPP networks. They present
hands-on practical advice on the design, implementation, and promotion of GPP networks and explore how this new form of
cooperation could help address the risks and opportunities presented by globalization. In our globalizing world, the United Nations needs to find ways to
collaborate with civil society and the global business community in tackling the challenges that lie ahead. By promoting GPP networks,
the United Nations will more effectively serve its member states and fulfill its mission to address the problems of humanity. It is our task
to make these networks work for all, in both North and South.","At the beginning of the 21st century, globalization has become the term of choice to describe the changing external environment in which all of us, individuals and institutions, now live and work. Yet, so far at least, governments and international organizations have fallen short in their efforts to develop mechanisms to allow their citizens to take full advantage of the opportunities that globalization offers. Nor have they succeeded in developing mechanisms that effectively respond to the risks that a social and economic transformation of this scope entails. This report discusses a mechanism global public-policy (GPP) networks — that has the potential to address both of these needs, and it considers their implications for international organizations in general and the United Nations in particular. Two forces, by now familiar to us all, stand out as driving the change in our international environment. First, for almost four decades
now, a general trend toward economic and political liberalization
has reshaped the international system. Economic liberalization has opened markets, increased competition, and sharpened the international division of labour. For many years this development was considered for the most part uncontroversial. But during the last decade, the dismantling of economic barriers has been met with growing apprehension, as transnational economic activity has generated a variety of negative spillover effects that governments and international organizations have so far been unable to address in a satisfactory manner. At the same time, many countries have been undergoing a related but often conflict-ridden process of political liberalization. This has fostered the growth of organizations representing what has come to be called civil society, and it has enabled them to build transnational linkages and alliances. Meanwhile, both political and economic liberalization have spurred the growth and reach of transnational corporations, which today account for a substantial share of economic activity in many countries.",,,Research Paper
Autonomous Institutional Arrangements in Multilateral Environmental Agreements_ A Little-Noticed Phenomenon in International Law.pdf,,,"This article demonstrates that intergovernmental treaty secretariats do bear bureaucratic authority and illustrates how this bureaucratic authority depends on
the activities of such secretariats. The cases of the Ozone Secretariat and the Desertiªcation Secretariat also indicate that there are marked differences in the
sources from which bureaucratic authority is generated and even more so with regard to the effects to which bureaucratic authority is employed. The Ozone Secretariat effectively utilizes its bureaucratic authority to fur-
ther the progressive development of the Montreal Protocol and how it is being implemented. In particular, the Ozone Secretariat successfully keeps the balance
between being an active player behind the scenes and being perceived as a neutral and “passive” tool from the viewpoint of governments. This quality is an
important source of its bureaucratic authority which has been appreciated by governments in the North and the South ever since the Montreal Protocol was
adopted. The diplomatic skill and personal authority of its Executive Secretaries has been quintessential to this end. The case shows, that for an intergovernmen-
tal treaty secretariat to be an authoritative bureaucratic actor, a neutral appearance is not an asset but a requirement. At the same time the example of the
“ozone ofªcers” shows, that this does not conªne treaty secretariats and their staff to a life of passive technocraticism, but it requires them to act cautiously
and considerately where they seek to pursue initiatives of their own making. Quite to the contrary, the Desertiªcation Secretariat has tipped the balance
by pushing delicate North-South issues. While these issues are related to the secretariat’s mandate in so far as they are covered by the UN Convention to Com-
bat Desertiªcation, they have, by the ways in which the secretariat operated, been perceived as reaching beyond the mandate. More importantly, they were
seen to offend the interests of powerful parties. This has adversely affected the authority of the secretariat which now ªnds itself struggling to regain conª-
dence amongst developed country parties. Its latitude to be actively involved in the overall regime process has decreased as parties have become more alert to
the secretariat’s activities and have demonstrated reluctance in following secretariat proposals. As a result, the secretariat’s potential to shape the ways in
which the convention is implemented has been seriously hampered. However,while the Executive Secretary certainly contributed to politicizing the relations
between the secretariat and developed country parties, it would be short sighted to blame this development solely on the moves of this experienced and highly
skilled diplomat. Rather, I would argue, the behavior of the secretariat reºects the evolution of the UN Convention to Combat Desertiªcation before the ac-
tual creation of the secretariat. The distinct history of the convention, and the parts many of today’s UNCCD senior ofªcers have individually played in it, sig-
niªcantly shape the bureaucratic personality of the Desertiªcation Secretariat. In particular, there is a peculiar organizational culture that might be interpreted
as a manifestation of the persistent driving forces that brought about the antidesertiªcation convention after two decades of tough North-South bargaining.
In this respect, it is only fair to attribute part of the responsibility for the current situation to the hypocrisy of developed countries. Rhetorically, they have ac-
cepted desertiªcation as a global problem, but politically they continue to view this as a concession to Southern interests rather than prioritizing it on their own
agenda. If this is indeed the case, the endeavors of the Desertiªcation Secretariat would appear as a steep uphill struggle. It remains plausible, however, that the
secretariat might be in a better position to play an authoritative role in the convention process today, had it acted more discreetly in its recent past.
In sum, it should be noted again, that international treaty secretariats are but one factor of effective environmental governance. Naturally, the outcomes
of international politics are ªrst and foremost determined by factors other than treaty secretariats and the intergovernmental civil servants employed by these secretariats. It is for this reason precisely that the larger part of the institution-
alist literature in International Relations does not conceive of intergovernmental secretariats as actors in their own right and only rarely attributes attention to
the roles they play apart from facilitating government interaction and providing fora for negotiations among nations. Indeed, the potential effects of secretariats
on the overall effectiveness of a given international environmental regime are limited as it is subject to a great number of factors that are beyond its grasp. In
particular, states remain the formal masters of a given regime. Nonetheless, as this article illustrates, states ªnd themselves reacting to authoritative intergov-
ernmental bureaucracies. The latter can hardly be blamed for poor regime effectiveness but will occasionally need to be commended for their contributions to
improving the speciªc outcomes of a regime. Often these will be outcomes that were not anticipated by the parties when crafting a treaty and providing for its
administration. Bureaucratic authority thus can make a meaningful difference to the ways in which an intergovernmental treaty is furthered or implemented.
Treaty secretariats will be the more effective in this regard, the more they are accepted as authoritative players in the overall regime setting. To make a
meaningful difference to global environmental politics they depend on the bureaucratic authority they muster vis-à-vis the other actors that operate in the re-
spective regime. Treaty secretariats can only be expected to affect the behavior of other stakeholders if they succeed in generating such bureaucratic authority. A
secretariat that performs poorly or is perceived as “misbehaving” in one way or another will instead undermine its own authority and limit its means to shape
the political processes around it. In short, the effects even of small treaty secretariats must not be underestimated. The more bureaucratic authority a secretariat acquires the more effective 
it will be. Systematically addressing the contributions intergovernmental treaty secretariats can make to effective environmental governance is thus essential for
a comprehensive analysis of global environmental politics.",,Research Paper
Befogged vision- International environmental governance a decade after Rio.pdf,,"Negotiators preparing for Rio+20 are missing an important opportunity. Reforming the institutional framework for sustainable development is a central part of the Rio+20 agenda. In
the run-up to Rio+20, negotiators have extensively discussed institutional reforms, but have focused almost exclusively on inter-governmental organizations such as UNEP and the CSD. At
the same time, however, private sustainability governance is flourishing. Since 1992, numerous organizations created by business, civil society groups, multi-stakeholder coalitions and other
private actors, as well as diverse public-private partnerships, have adopted important regulatory standards and implemented significant operational programs, including financing, project
support and information dissemination. Rio+20 negotiators remain almost wholly disengaged from these innovations. This public-private engagement gap 1 is both puzzling and troubling. Private sustainability
governance (PSG) has arisen primarily in response to the inadequacies of inter-state negotiations, institutions and policies; it provides momentum on many environment and development issues
while inter-state negotiations are stalled. Embracing PSG would bring this valuable engine of activity into the international system. Indeed, public engagement would be even more beneficial
than a “comparative statics” analysis suggests: supportive engagement would enhance the ability of PSG – and thus of the international system – to address the daunting challenges of
sustainability. This paper first contrasts the inter-state focus of Rio+20 preparations (Section 1) with the growth of PSG (Section 2). Section 3 examines the public-private engagement gap in practice and in
scholarship. Section 4 considers why the inter-state system has been loath to engage actively with PSG. Section 5 identifies a number of benefits that greater public engagement could
achieve. Finally, section 6 outlines workable mechanisms to strengthen public engagement, moving towards truly global sustainability governance.","Public engagement with private sustainability governance remains almost wholly off the political
agenda for Rio+20. This represents an opportunity missed. PSG is rapidly coming of age, and
can provide much-needed dynamism in the international system. Modest and feasible forms of
engagement, based on orchestration and regulatory cooperation, can enhance PSG and with it the
larger system of sustainability governance. The essential first step, for policy-makers and
scholars alike, is to recognize that PSG is not a distinct and isolated phenomenon, but an
essential component of global sustainability governance.",,Research Paper
Critical Choices_The United Nations_Networks and the Future of Global Governance.pdf,"This article discusses environmental policy integration—a concept so far mainly applied to domestic and European politics—at the global level. The article dis-
tinguishes between integration of institutions, of organizations, and of their bureaucracies, and it addresses both internal integration (within the environmental policy domain) and
external integration (between environmental policies and non-environmental policies). The overall focus is on one set of policy reform proposals that have been salient in the global
environmental governance debate for the last decades: the question of whether the creation of a world environment organization would improve the effectiveness, legitimacy, and
efficiency of global environmental governance. We revisit this debate and explore the options for organizational change, including clustering, upgrading, streamlining, and
hierarchical steering, with a focus on whether the reform proposals can bring about environmental policy integration. We conclude that in the longer term, upgrading of the
UN Environment Programme to a UN specialized agency, with additional and increasing streamlining of other institutions and bureaucracies, offers the most potential for envi-
ronmental policy integration and does not appear to be unrealistic",,"The debate on how to improve global environmental governance has proceeded in surges
and continues to do so, as new initiatives unfold and older ideas resurface. Currently,
reforming the UN system is mentioned as a top priority for UN Secretary General Ban
Ki-Moon (as it has been for his predecessors). 16 Recent UN proposals to strengthen the
environmental dimension of sustainable development include the recommendations of
the High-Level Panel on System Wide Coherence in their report Delivering as One and the
Inter-Linkages Initiative by the UN University, which advocates better harmonization and
coordination between multilateral environmental agreements. These proposals remain
close to the current system and offer potential for reform in the short term. Also, clustering
holds some promise for improvements. However, although parts of the literature present
clustering of institutions and bureaucracies as an option that renders a new world envi-
ronment organization redundant, clustering is more likely to be part of a larger solution
toward more effective global environmental governance and can be best understood as a
transitionary tool for pursuing this reform in a bottom-up process. In the longer term, upgrading UNEP and (later) streamlining it with other institutions
and bureaucracies appears as a both necessary and feasible option for reforming global
environmental governance, while at the same time offering potential for increasing envi-
ronmental policy integration at the global level (see Table 3 for a summary of our argu-
ment). The highest promise of both upgrading and streamlining lies in increased internal
environmental policy integration within the environmental realm. Integration beyond the
environmental sphere, most significantly by integrating environment and development, is
likely to be improved too, yet probably to a lesser degree.
Pursuing the upgrading and streamlining approach will bring organizational and insti-
tutional change to the current system, and realization of either option thus requires sub-
stantial support from all major governments. It is thus unlikely that either of these options
could be realized in the short term. Essential to the success of any new organization is the support from developing
countries. This is substantiated by the most recent phase in the debate on improving global
environmental governance. Brazil has instigated a new round of discussion, by giving the
proposal for a combined organization for environment and development new impetus. It
has recently started a new endeavor from within diplomatic circuits, to gather support for
such an organization. An organization combining environment and development is likely
to receive more support from developing countries, as developing countries often fear a
strong environmental organization would be detrimental to developmental issues. Incor-
porating these issues within a strong combined organization would prevent development
from a decline in consideration. However, merging environmental policies with develop-
ment policies in one institutional and organizational setting brings with it also certain
dangers, including the possibility that environmental concerns—which are of core interest
today also in the developing world—are effectively marginalized in the process (Biermann
2005, 132–135).
An alternative option—and probably the preferable one—would be to establish a strong
environmental organization while altering UNDP’s status simultaneously. This way, both
environment and development would have a strong voice, without compromising one or
the other. Developing countries might be easier inclined to support a new environmental
organization, when it involves improved status for UNDP as well.","Global environmental governance, United Nations, World environment organisation , Environmental policy integration ,

Does bureaucracy really matter_ The authority of intergovernmental treaty secretariats in global environmental politics.pdf,"Over the past five years there has been a growing interest in the systems of govern-
ance that determine the way in which the world works. The problems facing the
peoples of the world have not gone away since the report Governance for a Sustain-
able Future was launched by the World Humanity Action Trust (WHAT) in 2000.
There is progress in some areas, and awareness of the problems of poverty, AIDS
and global tensions of all kinds is growing. And although there are increasing signs
of consensus on the actions that are required, implementation of these is slow.
The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), held in Johannes-
burg in 2002, could be called a success in that a large number of people came
together to exchange ideas and experience regarding sustainable development.
However, the formal debates between government representatives too often feat-
ured self-congratulatory statements and a reluctance to commit to clearly defined
action. Nevertheless, new targets and a recommitment to the Millennium Develop-
ment Goals (MDGs) were eventually agreed. We all have a responsibility to ensure
that member states of the United Nations (UN) understand that those goals are
minimum targets and that, although achievement of them will go a long way towards
solving the problems of the world, further commitment and action is required.
The UN is far from perfect; but it remains our best hope if agreements are to
have a chance of succeeding. During the next few years, member states will have
to face the issue of how best to adapt the structure of the UN to improve its ability
to mould events through international agreements in a more coherent way. In
particular, the UN, in common with national governments everywhere, needs to
recognize the vital importance of moving beyond just talking about joined-up
thinking. We must escape from the mentality of looking at ‘everything in little
boxes’ that for too long has bedevilled policy-making and decision-making at all
levels of government in the world.
Following the merger of WHAT with Stakeholder Forum, the work on
governance systems has continued, and this book is a product of some of the
ideas that are beginning to emerge.
The book makes an important contribution to improving our understanding,
and points a way forward. We must all hope that it moves the world a little closer
to a sustainable future.",,"The recognition that the international sustainable development governance system
is deeply flawed is not new, not least as a result of the fragmentation caused by a
plethora of bodies and agencies, both within and outside the UN system, governing
the broad aspects of sustainable development. We have long recognized that a
disproportionate emphasis is placed on economic development, often to the
detriment of society and the environment. Of course, what is required is a significant
shift in the global governance architecture to bring about greater coherence in our
approach.
As each of the chapters in this book has outlined, reform at one level or in one
sector is not going to bring about the change in horizontal and vertical governance
that is required if we are to manage our world in a more sustainable way. Strength-
ening UNEP will, we hope, provide greater authority to protect the environment.
Reforming the WTO may also result in a fairer, more equitable and more
accountable trading system. Reform of the United Nations Security Council will
also encourage collective rather than unilateral action, and reform of the IFIs will
hopefully ensure that aid not only reaches those who need it the most, but is also
allocated to programmes determined by the recipient countries. But conducted
alone, these reform measures will only exacerbate the challenge of achieving
sustainable development.
This is not to say that what is needed is a new body to oversee the governance
of sustainable development – far from it – although, to some extent, this is what
the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) does thematically over its
two-year cycles. But what is required is a significant change in the way in which
different bodies at all levels – local, national, regional and international – interact.
No one agency can determine the activities of another; but strengthening the
relationship through, for example, the recently signed memorandum of
understanding (MoU) between UNEP and UNDP can certainly assist in bringing
greater cohesion to the system.
Regular reporting to the CSD may also serve as a useful tool, acting as an
accountability mechanism for all institutions, governments and stakeholders to
assess progress and highlight further opportunities to enhance governance
frameworks towards better implementation of sustainable development.
In order to truly achieve sustainable development, coherent and comple-
mentary policies and decisions need to be made at all levels, local to global. To
achieve this, what is required is greater coordination between government
departments, the UN, the IFIs, WTO and the wide breadth of civil society. Achiev-
ing this will require collaborative work, establishing an environment of respect
and openness to seek common ground, and the adoption of a shared objective:
sustainable development.",,
Engaging the Public and the Private in Global Sustainability Governance.pdf,"But the core question is
how do societies recognize the problems they face, and how can accurate and
timely responses be encouraged? Thus the study of international environmental
politics is intimately connected with the study of governance and learning.
Addressing international environmental issues is vitally important for human
survival. But we also are learning that environmental issues are tightly coupled to
other issues on the international agenda. Effective global governance of the
environment is necessary in order to preserve a livable future for the world’s
population. International environmental issues also provide a critical issue area—a
laboratory—for understanding the broader dynamics of other issues on the
international agenda as well. Many of the analytic properties of environmental
issues (the proliferation of non-state actors, the causal coupling between issues, and
the emergence of complexity and uncertainty as systemic conditions) presage shifts
in world politics from globalization. Environmental concerns serve as the leading edge of contemporary world
politics in two ways. First, they were the earliest issue to be widely recognized and
governed in terms of its complexity and uncertainty. Thus by understanding the
politics of international environmental politics we are better positioned to under-
stand and govern other issues as well. Second, because environmental issues are
linked to other issues, by starting with the environment decision makers move
towards governing causally coupled issues also.
The main argument or big story in this volume is one of gradual accommodation
to global structural change via social learning. As societies (governments, their
populations, and civil society groups) recognize the changing context of contem-
porary world politics, as articulated by epistemic communities, governance efforts
become more comprehensive in scope. Governance efforts work backwards to
address the social causes of environmental degradation. Scientific inputs help
inform comprehensive environmental governance and regimes that reflect scientific
causal understanding about the behavior of ecosystems. Last, governance efforts
work forwards to link the governance of environmental issues with linked social
activities. One example of this type of change is Gorbachev’s response to the
Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Gorbachev realized that Chernobyl wasn’t just an
instance of the transboundary effects of environmental disasters, but also of the
broader failures of centralized planning.
This brief summary of the social mechanisms of large-scale environmental
adaptation is an account that relies on hermeneutic changes. Political actors learn
about a changed policy environment from experts. Social scientists learn about
new political processes by observing policy learning, and through involvement
with the principal policy makers and scientists/epistemic community members.
Finally, the hermeneutic circle—or more properly the spiral—is followed as new
social scientific theories are developed to account for these new modes of governance,
and new practices are devised to address material problems.
My epistemology is pragmatic and evolutionary (Haas and Haas 2002). Better
understanding of governance occurs through focused work within individual
research approaches, which often relies on academic work and joint discussions by
academics and policy practitioners. Cumulative knowledge occurs within the aca-
demic community through evolutionary epistemology from engaged work
between research approaches (not just hypothesis testing, but also reflective
considerations about the utility of epistemological and ontological foundations)
(Campbell 1993; Adler 2005). Social change may ultimately occur from interplay
between academic and policy communities.
The chapters in this volume fall into several of these epistemic categories. Most
pieces are intended to build theory about epistemic communities and social learning.
Others test alternative hypotheses about patterns of environmental cooperation and
governance, primarily by assessing Institutionalist and Constructivist accounts.
Others are part of interactive policy dialogues with the practitioner/activist community.
Initial drafts of the following chapters were presented to the American Association
for the Advancement of Science (Chapter 2); the Nautilus Institute (Chapter 7);
the Commission on Global Governance (Chapter 12); the International MaritimePreface xvii
Organization Regional Programme on Building Partnerships in Environmental
Management for the Seas of East Asia (Chapter 14), and the Karl Deutsch
Memorial Lecture for the WZB (Chapter 18).",,"These two brief pieces point towards the effects of the broad patterns and dynamics
laid out in this volume. Social learning occurs as ideas are institutionalized through
the political involvement of epistemic communities in world politics.
The mechanism behind institutionalization is essentially linkage politics.
Substantively, shared conceptions of linkages become increasingly broader, by
virtue of the spreading influence of ecological epistemic communities and their
comprehensive notions of connections between coupled issues. Constitutive forces
are also at play, as scientists and experts increasingly become legitimate participants
in international decision making, thus consolidating their ideas in the political
landscape, as they privilege specific international institutions and the application of
their ideas.
“Promoting knowledge-based international governance” (Chapter 17) provides
a roadmap for networked knowledge-based governance that can lead to more
sustainable global governance. Networked knowledge may lead to a wider reliance
on experts and epistemic communities. As decision makers grow more confident
and experienced in their delegation to experts, the prospects improve for a broader
and more coupled agenda between a diverse array of issues: between environmental
issues and between environmental issues and other issues, such as trade, foreign aid,
development policy, and security.
“The global spreading of ideas” (Chapter 18) looks at emergent patterns of
environment governance resulting from institutionalized epistemic involvement in
global environmental governance over the last 40 years. As the number of regimes
informed by epistemic influence grows, and an increasing number of states ratify
them and enforce them domestically, a broader social recognition of reliance on
nature occurs. Causally such recognitions lead to changes in the governance of
coupled issue areas. Broader norms of environmental protection and sustainability
are also possible, as the new practices get codified and acquire normative consensus.370 Conclusion
Direct and indirect forces guide future trajectories of governance. States and
elites are directly influenced by epistemic communities and learn about new state
systemic properties and adopt new state responsibilities. Indirectly, states become
caught up in a broader network of institutionalized incentives and behavioral
expectations for environmental protection. Political economy forces are created
from these political foundations, leading to new environmental domestic corporate
constituencies and the emergence of markets which favor environmental protection
rather than its degradation. States become more likely to subscribe to normative
commitments for the environment. Ecological ideas about linkages within and
between systems become more widely taken for granted and applied to global
governance.
Future work on epistemic communities and governance can help document
and trace these new mechanisms of political influence and change.",,
Environmental policy integration and the architecture of global environmental governance.pdf,"Norms shape policy when they get translated into concrete programs. What if a widely shared norm
gets translated into a weak program? How might this influence the program’s legitimacy? We
examine these issues in the context of the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary program
that embodies the widely shared norm of corporate responsibility. While both international inter-
governmental organization (IGO) and international non-governmental organization (INGO) net-
works support this norm, they differ on the adequacy of the Compact’s program design. We explore
how this tension affects the diffusion of the Compact across countries, which vary in their levels of
embeddedness in IGO and INGO networks. Our findings suggest that embeddedness in IGO
networks encourages adoption, while embeddedness in INGO networks discourages it. Our analy-
sis provides important lessons for sponsors of voluntary governance mechanisms. Widespread
support for a norm does not automatically ensure support for a program that claims to embody it.",,"Ideas can inform public policy. A poor response to a given program might not necessarily
reflect a rejection of the norm that motivated it. Rather, it might reflect the inadequate
translation of the norm into the program. A careful study of program design should
therefore figure prominently in the research agenda of scholars studying how norms
inform policy and governance. Instead of assuming that widely shared norms will be
translated into programs which key norm governors will find acceptable, scholars need to
explore why and how programs acquire certain design attributes, and what are the
consequences of design choices for the diffusion of the program and the norm.
Program design pertains to the issues of stringency, monitoring, disclosure, sanctions,
and enforcement, many of the same issues considered in the literature on institutional
design (Koremenos et al. 2001; Potoski & Prakash 2009). It involves conflicting goals, such
as strength versus inclusiveness, and different norm governors may desire different choices. While “strong” programs provide a greater assurance that program participants
will honor the norm, such programs may set the bar too high, or make it a high cost
program – eventually leading to low levels of program participation. If governors disagree
on the prioritization of the goals of widespread program participation in relation to
maintaining norm integrity, conflicts among them might break out. How such tradeoffs
take place in different issue areas is an issue for future research.
The literature on voluntary programs suggests (as is also attested by the failure of
voluntary regulations in financial markets, especially the one sponsored by the Securities
and Exchange Commission) that voluntary programs which do not impose real obliga-
tions on firms or do not back them with sufficient monitoring – “bluewashes” or “Astro-
turfs” – have a greater chance of failure (Cutler et al. 1999; Haufler 2001; Mattli and Büthe
2003; Vogel 2005). As Daniel Mittler of Greenpeace International notes: “the world does
not need more declarations of intent from corporations, but real actions that can be
measured and monitored” (Global Policy Forum 2007). In the case of the Global
Compact, IGO networks appear to prefer more inclusive programs while INGO networks
place greater value on program integrity. Both broadly support and advocate for the
norm of CR, yet differ over this program. Instead of treating IGO and INGO networks as
undifferentiated components of a World Society with uniform effects on states, our paper
suggests that scholars recognize a more conflictual and differentiated nature of global
society. If IGO or NGO networks serve to transmit such weak programs, it raises a serious
question as to whether the increasing density of World Society networks will always have
beneficial outcomes for humanity.","global governance, institutional design, norms, policy diffusion, United Nations

Epistemic Communities_Constructivism_and International Environmental Politics.pdf,"Climate change adaptation is increasingly being mainstreamed into all types of
organizations across the world. A large number of intergovernmental organizations
(IGOs), such as the European Union, the World Bank, or Food and Agriculture
Organization, have already started to mainstream adaptation. Yet, despite a surge
in scholarly interest in climate policy integration over the past decade, adaptation
is still predominantly studied as a local issue and mainstreaming in IGOs remains
poorly understood. In this article, we develop and test an innovative framework for
examining adaptation mainstreaming practices in IGOs. Using quantitative and
qualitative data derived from extensive ﬁeldwork conducted between 2017 and
2020, we examine mainstreaming practices in a large number of IGOs and arrive at
two key ﬁndings. First, adaptation has been mainstreamed within the procedures
and outputs of IGOs across ten (nonclimate) issue areas, while there is also
evidence of important issue-speciﬁc variation. Second, there is variation across
mainstreaming practices in the sense that discursive mainstreaming is most
common, whereas more concrete collaboration, policy change aﬀecting projects
and programs, and budget allocations are less common. We conclude with a
discussion of how our framework can inform the theory and practice of global
adaptation governance.",,"Global adaptation governance is emerging as an important ﬁeld of inquiry (Persson, 2019), yet we know little
about the dynamics of adaptation mainstreaming within IGOs. Given that IGO mainstreaming practices are
central to the theory and practice of global adaptation governance, more research is needed on this topic
(see also Tosun & Peters, 2018). Prior studies have considered the beneﬁts, inconsistencies, lacunae, redundan-
cies, and trade-oﬀs associated with CPI and EPI (e.g. Jordan & Lenschow, 2010; Van Asselt et al., 2015). To assess
impacts, we need a better understanding of the ways and extent to which IGOs have mainstreamed adaptation.
With that in mind, this article has conceptualized adaptation mainstreaming in IGOs as a set of practices. We
have developed an analytical framework to analyse adaptation mainstreaming in IGOs, distinguishing between
four major types of mainstreaming practices: discursive, collaboration, programs and projects, and
budget allocation. Our quantitative and qualitative evidence suggests two key ﬁndings.
First, adaptation has been mainstreamed into the procedures and outputs of many IGOs, but to varying
degrees and typically without allocation of budgetary resources to ensure action. While IGOs are favourable
to discursively interpret their mandates as including climate change adaptation, there is comparatively
weaker mainstreaming through its concrete operations in the form of collaboration, and integration into pro-
jects and programs. We also ﬁnd evidence for failure to follow through to action through the allocation of bud-
getary resources to enable the mainstreaming adaption in projects and programs.
This ﬁnding underlines previous studies arguing there is an implementation deﬁcit in adaptation govern-
ance (see also Runhaar et al., 2018). As adaptation has only recently been formally recognized as a global
issue in the 2015 Paris Agreement, discursive practices for many IGOs still appear to constitute a critical ﬁrst
step in which the relevance of adaptation is negotiated and contested. By contrast, other mainstreaming prac-
tices are comparatively rare, especially if they require explicit budgetary allocations. Indeed, funding ﬂowing to
IGOs is increasingly voluntary and earmarked, while adaptation funding is still scarce (Hall, 2017), implying that
IGOs have little the ﬁscal capacity or wiggle room to address adaptation challenges.
Second, we ﬁnd important variation in the extent of adaptation mainstreaming across the ten diﬀerent issue
areas studied here. Mainstreaming adaptation has advanced most in IGOs focused on food and development
and least in those focused on migration and security. Despite this dynamic, the data has uncovered two central
puzzles that are worth highlighting. The ﬁrst is that FAO stands out as a leader in its discursive mainstreaming of
adaptation, yet FAO is amongst the least advanced in the allocation of budgetary resources to adaptation.
Second, regional multi-issue IGOs are shown to be the most advanced to allocation of budgetary resources
to adaptation mainstreaming. As adaptation funds tend to privilege agricultural, development, and water pro-
jects, this is a surprising outcome, but may reﬂect the unequal access of IGOs to these funds. Explaining this is a
topic for future research that might comparatively assess possible explanations for the variation in IGO adap-
tation mainstreaming, for example, across diﬀerent types of organizations and diﬀerent types of mainstreaming
practices, issue areas, and time frames.
Based on our analysis, we identiﬁed key barriers to successful mainstreaming. Barriers include: opposition
from powerful states; institutional fragmentation; scarce external funding available for IGOs working on issue areas typically not associated with adaptation; and incompatibility between principles and time horizons
for adaptation versus the target issue area for the IGO. Opposition to adaptation from powerful member states
often leads to a reliance on discursive mainstreaming, which can in turn generate either support or resistance to
mainstreaming in practice, and is thus consequential for other mainstreaming practices (see also Dellmuth
et al., 2020). Institutional fragmentation constituted a signiﬁcant barrier for collaborative practices, in particular
in cases where IGOs faced ‘conﬂictive fragmentation’ characterized by relatively siloed institutions and conﬂict-
ing norms. Finally, funding constraints and time horizons inﬂuence all mainstreaming practices.
Future research could fruitfully build on our exploratory analysis to explain the conditions under which these
barriers aﬀect variation in IGO mainstreaming practices. Notably, large-n studies or qualitative comparative case
studies (cf. George & Bennett, 2005) could analyse the eﬀects of intra-organizational processes on mainstream-
ing outcomes. For instance, two IGOs within the same issue area with varying degrees of mainstreaming, such
as AFDB and WB, or IOM and UNHCR, could be studied in terms of how variation in intra-organizational
dynamics through which international bureaucrats respond to structural barriers can explain mainstreaming
outcomes in otherwise similar external contexts. Comparison could also be made across issues areas in
which external factors vary strongly, to systematically analyse how and when external factors shape variation
in global practices to mainstream adaptation. To paraphrase Van Asselt et al. (2015), actors must consider the
functional relationship between adaptation and external factors, such as the target sector, political commit-
ment, institutional contexts, and politicization or public engagement.
In summary, additional research is needed to evaluate the causes and consequences of diﬀerent approaches
to IGO mainstreaming and to understand how this aﬀects outcomes in the context of global adaptation
governance.",,

Global adaptation governance_how intergovernmental organizations mainstream climate change adaptation.pdf,"The article by Lisa Maria Dellmuth and Maria-Therese Gustafsson examines the integration of climate change adaptation into the practices of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) following its recognition as a global issue in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The authors argue that while adaptation has been increasingly mainstreamed across various non-climate issue areas, significant variation exists in the extent and effectiveness of this integration, with discursive practices being the most common form of mainstreaming. They identify key barriers to successful adaptation mainstreaming, including opposition from powerful states, institutional fragmentation, and limited funding. The research highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of adaptation governance, suggesting that future studies should explore the dynamics of adaptation practices across different IGOs and issue areas.

Global Environmenetal Institutions.pdf,"International organizations are critical for global environmental
policymaking as catalytic agents of desirable change, and in the case of the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) as the coordinative
mechanism as well. Only in the face of severe degradation or impending
catastrophies has the world community responded to challenges. However,
for the policy to be effective, the necessary financial support needs to be
generated, assured, and vastly increased; and the locus of policy making
shifted to a main organ of the United Nations-conceivably as an
Environmental Council, supplanting the Trusteeship Council and being
co-equal in status with the Economic and Social Council, with the UNEP as
its coordinative arm.",,"The Stockholm Conference of 1972 ushered in a new era of environmental
consciousness and activity in the international community. The creation of UNEP
provided an institutional framework for dealing with the environmental problems in
the world. The coordinative and catalytic role of UNEP has proved valuable in
orchestrating policy responses at various levels-national, regional, international,
and global-in relation to continuing and emergent environmental challenges.
Unfortunately, the voluntary contributions by governments to UNEP's Environmen-
tal Fund have been woefully short of what is needed to make an impact on a rapidly
deteriorating situation. An adequate program of reforestation alone is likely to cost an
estimated $60 billion between 1989 and 2000 (Brown and Wolf, 1988: 173-176;
WCED, 1987: ch. 12). Hence, generating financial support is one of the most critical
challenges confronting the global environmental policy.
The Montreal Protocol may have established an operative principle of global
policy: that an equitable distribution of the economic/opportunity costs of
environmental regulation of the commons is imperative for generating global
response. In regard to the ""greenhouse"" issue, there appears to be no policy choice
available now which can help avert the warming of the planet during the next
century. The cumulative damage has already been done; and it cannot be undone
""quickly."" Several other lessons from the global environmental policy experience may
be posited briefly:
-nations will agree to act collectively only when their perception of threat/risk from
an impending or actual global environmental catastrophe is acute and direct;
-nations will give higher priority to economic/developmental factors in cases of
moderate or low perceptions of threat/risk from environmental crises, especially
when there is a conflict between economic and environmental considerations;
-the long-established habits of doing ""business-as-usual"" at the international level
are likely to change very slowly if no impetus is available to transform them in
desirable ways;
-the necessary impetus is likely to come from the IGOs, such as UNEP or other aagencies in the United Nations system, INGOs such as IUCN or WWF, from some
of the environmentally enlightened national leaders such as Prime Minister
Brundtland of Norway, or from the environmental movements at the grassroots
level within and among nations, such as the Chipko movement in India, or the
Greens in Europe;
-as the pressures on the global eco-system increase, and crises unfold, more global
policy responses are likely to be forthcoming, and the scope of policy making is
likely to widen-thus encompassing more issue areas. However, lack of adequate
funding and/or political will to take appropriate action in time will act as severe
constraints on global environmental policy and corresponding action within
national jurisdictions.
The implications of these observations for global environmental policy may also be
stated rather tersely. The move toward a sustainable society globally will require
drastic changes in the lifestyles of the affluent cultures in the developed nations.
Technology is a two-edged instrument; it will have to be harnessed wisely and
appropriately. The developing nations will have to commit themselves to a
substantial curbing of their population growth in the near future. As the economic
problems of a large number of developing nations become more intractable, their
already weak commitment to environmental protection and restoration is likely to
slacken further. Immense financial resources will have to be generated and made
available globally on very reasonable terms to address the twin challenges of
environmental preservation as well as promoting sustainable development.
UNEP may have to coordinate more intensively global policy responses and their
effective implementation. That, however, requires more stable and vastly increased
funding, and raising the status of that organization. Already there are proposals in the
UN for involving the Security Council in the peace-related aspects of environmental
degradation. It may well be that the UN could be made more effective in its
environmental role if the Trusteeship Council, whose work is almost done, were to be
replaced with an Environmental Council with the same status as the Economic and reducing further environmental degradation may be tolerable. In the long run, the
challenge is to restore the planet. Environmental logic demands broad-based
international cooperation and coordination of policies, and requires the international
community to evolve effective global environmental policies. Given the magnitude of
the problems, and their profound implications, there is no place for exclusive national
responses in addressing most of these challenges. The fate of the Earth, as well as our
own, depends on what we choose to do
Social Council. Then, UNEP could become the coordinative arm of the
Environmental Council. Putting into effect the UNCLOS III Convention of 1982,
and releasing its potential as a funding source, may also help anchor the fragile
environmental policy framework. In some cases, global environmental policy
responses have already turned out to be ""too little, too late."" Diversion of excessive
expenditures from thermonuclear weapons systems to environmental preservation
may help the world community avoid the global catastrophe of a ""nuclear winter.""
And, even in the conventional arms area, there is immense scope for disarmament
and thus for the reallocation of funds to global environmental tasks. In other areas,
nations do not seem to be ""learning"" from experience so far. A convention permitting
regulated development of oil and mineral resources of all of Antarctica, initialled by
33 nations in Wellington, New Zealand, in June 1988 frustrates efforts to have
Antarctica declared a World Conservation Area in order to protect the unspoilt
nature of this integral component of the global eco-system. The convention is to take
effect as soon as 16 of the 20 voting members of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 ratify th
agreement. Thus, it would seem that the economic calculation of nations is about to
prevail, with potentially disastrous consequences for the global eco-system. An
informed and wise global policy requires ""anticipatory"" thinking as well as concerted
and timely actions undertaken with a sense of urgency which has characterized recent
policy developments with regard to ozone depletion. In the short run, policies of",,Journal
Global Environmental Commons_Analytical and Political Challenges in Building Governance Mechanisms.pdf,"Document 1 (Page 4): The essays in this collection provide valuable insights into urban planning and economics, particularly in international contexts. Authors Martim Smolka and Ciro Biderman challenge the stereotypical view of slums by highlighting the strategic choices made by low-income individuals regarding housing and transportation, suggesting that transport costs can serve as a substitute for monetary credit. Margaret Grieco emphasizes the need for improved transportation planning in African cities, advocating for infrastructure that supports local economies and accessibility for marginalized groups. However, the book lacks comprehensive discussions on benefit-cost analysis, nonprofit organizations, feminist perspectives, and communicative planning, which are essential for a holistic understanding of urban issues. The text is primarily aimed at educators and students in urban economics and planning, offering theoretical frameworks and empirical reviews, though some essays may be overly technical for practical planners.

Document 2 (Page 2): This review highlights the multifaceted nature of urban economics and planning, emphasizing the importance of understanding various themes such as economic development, public finance, and international settings. The authors aim to provide a theoretical foundation rather than practical solutions, making the book more suitable for academics than practicing planners. The extensive literature reviews included in the essays serve to connect theoretical concepts to real-world applications, although some contributions may be dense and challenging for students. The text ultimately seeks to stimulate discussion and enhance the teaching of urban economics, while also acknowledging the differences in perspectives between urban economists and planners, particularly regarding policy implications and equity considerations.

Gerston's narrative reveals a state in decline, grappling with governance challenges and a lack of urgency among its leaders. While the breadth of topics covered is impressive, the depth of analysis often feels shallow, with many themes presented in a fragmented manner. The strongest sections focus on political structures and the impact of special interests, providing valuable insights into the state's fiscal crisis and governance challenges, ultimately calling for a more engaged and informed citizenry to address these pressing issues.

of actors in addition to national governments, the traditional core ac-
tors in international environmental politics; second, the emergence of
new mechanisms and institutions of global environmental governance

third, increasing segmentation and fragmentation of the overall gover-
nance system across levels and functional spheres. In the last section,

1. The term global (environmental) governance is used in three different notions: as an
analytic description of current transformations of global politics, as a political program
in the afﬁrmative sense, and as a political program in the critical sense.
2. In particular, global environmental governance describes world politics that are no longer
conﬁned to the governments of nation states, but are characterized by increasing partic-
ipation and relevance of other actors. These nonstate actors include experts and scien-
tists, environmentalist nongovernmental organizations, business associations, cities and
provinces, as well as intergovernmental bureaucracies.
3. The increased participation of nonstate actors has also given rise to new forms of in-
stitutions in addition to the traditional system of legally binding documents negotiated
by states. More and more nonstate actors become formally part of norm-setting and
norm-implementing institutions and mechanisms in global environmental governance,
which denotes a shift from intergovernmental regimes to public-private and increasingly
private-private cooperation and global policy making.
4. The emerging global environmental governance system is ﬁnally characterized by an
increasing fragmentation and segmentation of different layers and clusters of rule making
and rule implementing.
5. Fragmentation increases both vertically—between supranational, international, national,
and subnational layers of authority (multilevel governance)—and horizontally between
different parallel rule-making systems maintained by different groups of actors (multi-
polar governance).","institutions, interlinkages, international environmental politics,

involvement in environmental lawmaking. These critics claim that global
networks are not legitimate international actors because they answer to no one in
their power wielding political activity. Under a discourse approach, the
legitimacy of networks-both environmental and business-lies in their ability
to infuse the institutional debate with different policy perspectives and
arguments, out of which well-informed, consensual decisions may be reached.
The Article concludes by pointing to some of the implications flowing from a
discourse approach for institutional design.","Implementing the ideals of deliberative democracy has important
advantages, especially for environments characterized by a high level of cultural
pluralism, where there are enduring differences in the conceptions of the good.
Collective decisions in deliberative democracy are not made only through
aggregating pre-existing preferences of the members of the community, but
mainly through deliberation. The first, informally organized arena of deliberation
is the network, which is located within the public sphere (""weak publics"").
Members of the network attempt to influence each other's opinion by engaging in a discourse in which they examine and critique the positions of others, while
explaining the reasons for their own views. The persuasive appeal of the better
argument, under this view, is the main legitimizing factor of collective decisions.
The second deliberative arena includes formally organized institutions of the
political system, where political will-formation takes place, or in other words,
where law is created (""strong publics""). While it is important to keep civil society
separate from and independent of the political system, the interaction between
the two publics, the ""weak"" and the ""strong,"" can sometimes be genuinely
deliberative. This Article has argued that this conceptual framework is useful in
making sense of the relative success of the climate change negotiations and for
understanding the centrality of ENGO and BINGO networks in the formation
of the regime.
While the relatively inclusive approach to network input taken by the
UNFCCC resulted in a framework that has made significant strides toward the
regulative ideal of discourse, it is still far from fully conforming to it. One
difficulty identified above is the artificial distinction in the UNFCCC
nongovernmental organization admission criteria between for-profit entities
(who may not be admitted) and associations of for-profit entities (who may be
allowed in as observers). Corporate actors' inability to influence the policy
process directly was one of the factors leading to a destabilization of the
business network because it affected its ability to reach a reasoned consensus
among its members.' 23 Allowing private companies to register directly as
observers may have the same equalizing effect it had on the ENGO network, by
emphasizing the voluntary basis of participation in the network and its
nonhierarchical nature. Members then participate not because they must act
through the network, since they would have an easy alternative to voice their
arguments independently of the network, but because they truly want to
deliberate in order to reach a consensus. If consensus is not reached at the
network level, this increased flexibility of corporate participation would still
benefit the institutional deliberative process by broadening the range of business
perspectives considered in the negotiations.
Moreover, discourse does not end with the conclusion of the negotiations
and the adoption of legal instruments. The successful implementation of norms
is also part of the lawmaking endeavor, and it depends on the discursive qualities
of the process. So far, state parties to the UNFCCC have chosen not to extend
the involvement of nonstate actors beyond the treaty-making stage and to allow
them, for example, to get involved in the Non-Compliance Procedure under the
UNFCCC' 24 While the overall approach to resolving disputes relating to noncompliance with the treaty is facilitative rather than adversarial-and for that
it may exhibit distinctly discursive qualities- it is not envisioned by state parties
as particularly inclusive. Nonstate actors will not be permitted to file complaints
against violating states, or to submit questions of implementation to the
UNFCCC Compliance Committee. Only state parties may trigger the Non-
Compliance Procedure and debate the matter among themselves. Closing off
this institutional deliberative forum to the input of all affected actors may
compromise the legitimacy of the regime as it evolves in the future.",,
Global Networks and International Environmental Lawmaking_ A Disc.pdf,"A constitutional turn is needed to bring the UN system in line with the urgent needs of
planetary stewardship and earth system governance in the 21 st century. Yet how this
could be organized in practice remains a challenge and subject to political and
scholarly debate. This paper contributes to this debate by outlining four reforms of the
UN system that would advance global decision-making by addressing major
shortcomings in the current system: Lack of integration of economic and
environmental policies in the UN system; institutional fragmentation and weakness of
the environmental pillar of sustainable development; lack of high-level regulatory
competence and oversight regarding areas beyond national jurisdiction; and
insufficient integration of scientific insights into political decision-making. The
reforms proposed would together create an Earth Alliance in the UN system,
consisting of a high-level UN Sustainable Development Council, a World Environment
Organization, a UN Trusteeship Council for Areas beyond National Jurisdiction, and
an UN Global Environmental Assessment Commission.",,"In sum, the proposal of an “Earth Alliance” of UN agencies and programs would
constitute a major reform of the UN system. Yet it would not be without precedence
in national political systems, and not even in global governance. Economic, financial
and trade governance, in particular, has seen tremendous increases in global
institutionalization in recent decades, not the least by the creation of the powerful
regulatory systems under the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank. Yet sustainable development and planetary stewardship go
beyond mere economic growth, the main target of current economic governance.
Influential institutions are needed to protect the vital planetary systems on which
human survival depends. After the creation of the United Nations in 1945 to ensure
international peace, and the strengthening in the 1990s of economic governance systems, what is now needed is a new constitutional moment to strengthen the overall
institutional framework for effective governance of the interaction of human societies
with the planetary system.",,

Greening the United Nations charter_World politics in the anthropocene.pdf,"In the process of globalization, several international actors have emerged besides states. The intergovernmental
cooperation resulting from treaties or agreements in the forms of Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs) has been
viewed as an appropriate mean for dealing with various issues in global and regional levels. Whilst IGOs may focus on
a wide range of areas such as education, culture, and political affairs, this study primarily addresses their roles and
activities in security, economy, health, and environment. To that aim, their evolution, roles, and activities were
elaborated through giving several examples of IGOs. The Union of International Associations’ (UIA) online database
about international organizations was examined through categorizing the IGOs’ main interests as security, economy,
health, and environment. The study compared and evaluated the quantities of IGOs considering their types and
interests. The number of established IGOs has increased along with the process of globalization. The present study
revealed that most IGOs have been established for economic purposes whilst security, health, and environment have
been other key interests of IGOs. Economy and security interests have been more common in universal and
intercontinental membership organizations. Economy and environment, on the other hand, have been more prevalent
purposes in other types of IGOs including regional and financial ones. Health has been the least common interest of
IGOs amongst the interests in question. The IGOs such as the UN and NATO have advanced their activities and become
more important in the last decades. The evolving role of IGOs shows that they will remain key actors in global system.",,"The advancements in communication and transportation technologies have accelerated globalization
processes since the 1990s. The roles and activities of intergovernmental organizations have enlarged in this
process. IGOs’ supervisory and regulatory roles have evolved and are highly varied today. The present
study revealed that most IGOs have been established for economic purposes. Security, health, and
environment have been other key interests of IGOs. The quantities of IGOs focusing on security, economy,
health and environment can be varied in all types of IGOs. Economy and security interests have been
common in universal and intercontinental membership organizations, whereas economy and environment
have been main purposes in the other types of IGOs including regional and financial ones.
The networks of IGOs in security and economic activities have become more complicated, and not
only states but also non-state actors have begun to cooperate with each other to solve global problems. The
associated increase in trans-governmental networks has led to an increase in the numbers and significance of
IGOs. For example, the UN’s roles and scope of activities have been expanded from security to a great many
areas. The UN has also been viewed as important because of its evolving role in filling the global governance
gaps in recent years. Additionally, globalization has led to changes in both the attitudes and structure of
economic global institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF and they became global authorities
considering the global community. NATO, a regional security organization, has changed its structure to deal
with evolving global security problems. These recent changes in the role of IGOs show that IGOs will
continue to be important actors in global arena.","Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs), Roles and Activities of IGOs, Global Security, Economy, Health, Environment.",
Institutions for the earth_ sources of effective international environmental protection.pdf,"The ‘fragmentation’ of international law is used as a term of description and — more
commonly — as a lament. It emphasises the isolation and disconnect between regimes and
institutions and has particular resonance within international environmental law; a complex
regulatory field comprising multiple regimes and institutions giving rise to overlapping and,
occasionally, conflicting legal and policy mandates. This article will focus on the extent to which
environmental governance strategies, in particular, the creation of formal cooperative
arrangements and other institutional connections between multilateral environmental
agreements (‘MEAs’), can be deployed, not just to manage the consequences of overlap and
outright conflict between regimes, but also to maximise the benefits that arise from a confluence
between MEA mandates. This article will argue that these governance strategies represent an
important mechanism for managing the consequences of fragmentation and improving the
effectiveness of international environmental governance. Nevertheless, closer cooperation and
institutional integration among MEAs also raise serious questions relating to the accountability
of the regime to its state parties and, more generally, to the legitimacy of that regime. Moreover,
the impact of this new form of international environmental governance potentially extends
beyond the realm of international environmental law; these governance strategies arguably
challenge the fundamentals of the international legal system itself: who we regard as
participants within the system, what the sources of international law are and even international
law’s ultimate basis in consent",,,,

International Governance on Environmental Issues.pdf,"Impressive numbers of global and regional
governmental and non-governmental organizations are
working in the field of the marine environment and its
resources. Many of these organizations operate within
international legal frameworks ranging from
comprehensive global conventions, such as the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to regional
agreements aiming at protection and development of
regional seas. Characteristic for the management of these
seas, both at the national and international level, is that
sectoral approaches predominate. Over time, several
initiatives have been taken to improve cooperation,
coordination and integration to achieve greater coherence
of policies and strategies between different organizations
dealing with marine and maritime management, within and
outside the United Nation system. However, the success
has been limited. The weaknesses of international
organizations depend fundamentally on problems at the
national level. The international organizations are no
stronger than their Contracting Parties allow them to be",,"International and national marine environmental gover-
nance need well-functioning organizations and legal
frameworks as a basis for action and in support of
responsible and effective marine and maritime manage-
ment by individual countries, as emphasized in the
following:
Future marine and maritime management needs even
greater emphasis on international cooperation through
well-functioning multilateral organisations. This,
requires relevant mandates by national governments
to take on board global or regional processes, expert
roles and normative frameworks;  The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
and Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 has become the overall
legal and programme framework for ocean affaires
(see ‘‘Intergovernmental and non-governmental orga-
nizations outside the UN system’’ section). However,
to make it effective, present shortcomings of the
system have to be resolved and realistic global,
regional and national maritime policies with clear
targets and timetables need to be developed and
agreed upon. In this respect MSP, ICAM and ecosys-
tem-based management—if properly developed, leg-
ally implemented and effectively enforced—are
management instruments that can contribute to a more
coherent, multi-sectorally coordinated management of
the use, conservation and protection of the marine and
coastal environment and its resources, including
freshwater catchments;
Beside the global, legal and institutional frameworks
for ocean affairs the importance of regional organisa-
tions and conventions within and outside the UN
system has grown as bases for action. In fact, imple-
mentation of several environmental global programmes
is carried out at a regional level by organisations such
as HELCOM, OSPAR, the Regional Seas Programmes
of UNEP and the regional fisheries organizations
related to FAO. The regional programmes and their
Contracting Parties are closer to the problems. They
can often deal more effectively with the regional
specificities, capabilities and perceived priorities, for
instance, regarding measures to reduce pollution and
establish marine protected areas;
Although the assessment capacity is strong in many
regions, there is a clear need to develop greater
expertise and infrastructure around the globe in the
technical aspects of marine assessment. Not least, there
is a need to develop new and more consistent ways to
value environmental goods and services, and internalize
such valuing requirements in sector legislation (Kill
2015); and
The further development of the underwater marine
technology facilitates opportunities to increase infor-
mation and communication on the marine environment
its problems and values. This will in turn increase the
public awareness of marine and maritime issues, as well
as the possibility of NGOs to influence and put pressure
on countries’ policies and practices for marine and
maritime management.","Convention, International organization ,Marine , Planning and management

International marine environmental governance- A review.pdf,,"The pressing problems of global environmental change have challenged the
international research community to generate new theoretical understandings,
methodological reﬁnements and empirical knowledge of its institutional
dimensions. Most of this work, however, has concentrated on the principles,
norms, rules and decision-making procedures that underlie the emerging
system of global environmental governance. More systematic work will
be necessary to better understand the actors at the international level that
identify, analyse, manage and evaluate the problems of global environmental
change. This particularly applies in the case of the plethora of intergovern-
mental organizations and programmes that are entrusted with assisting in
the mitigation of, and adaptation to, global environmental change. These
organizations are hence in the central focus of this book.
All contributions to this volume were ﬁrst presented at the 2005 Berlin
Conference on the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change,
which was held in December 2005 under the overall theme of ‘International
Organizations and Global Environmental Governance’. What became clear
during this conference was the broad and rising scholarly interest in the work,
inﬂuence and deﬁciencies of international organizations in particular in the
ﬁeld of global environmental governance. In total, more than 150 papers
were presented at this conference. The studies in this book were selected as
the best conference papers by the two conference chairs – who served as
editors of the present volume – and their international advisory group. All
papers were subsequently revised, submitted to peer review, and subsequently
further amended and updated.

International organizations and global governance agenda_ SDGs as a paragon.pdf,"International organizations are predominantly innovative capacity-building measures for
the conduct of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy in an increasingly complex and symbiotically
interdependent global community. Thus, international organizations are important actors in
international relations for the conduct and operations of global governance. However, international
organizations have in recent time suffered crises of legitimacy and effectiveness due in part to the
current global wave of nationalistic aspirations accentuated by forces of globalization. To this end, the
paper situates these new forms of populism within the precinct of globalization theory supported
heavily by secondary sources of data. Using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an initiative
of the United Nations as a model, anchored on content analysis and review the paper argues that the
global transformative agenda for people, planet and prosperity could become the most effective
vehicle for promoting global governance agenda. It concludes that the twin tyrannies of poverty and
war, which fundamentally dominate the objectives of international organizations and by implication,
global governance agenda, can be defeated on a more measurable scale under the SDGs. It canvasses
that all the global stakeholders both in public and private sectors must intensify their collaborative
partnership in order to meet the vision 2030 target in the SDGs’ agenda.",,"This paper has strongly and persistently advanced the notion that prominent
international organizations are fast losing their relevance and credibility on the
basis of fulfilling their traditional goals of global governance. It premised this
argument on the fact that changing dynamics in international relations accentuated
by the vibrations of globalization are jointly responsible for the erosion of the old
templates of global governance structures. Worse still, the world’s multilateral
institutions, with the UN at the centre, are ill-equipped, unable, or seemingly
unwilling to reform and catalyse quick, necessary and drastic action in the face of
major global crises. The paper repeatedly inferred that without adequate framework
to bring order to an international system in flux, disorder could prevail, fuelling
greater instability. Thus, the mix of old and new challenges generate new
requirements for collective problem-solving, more international cooperation and
innovative approaches. This, in our assessment, describes eloquently the SDGs
model as a modern structure for global governance initiative.
Flowing from the above assertion, it is evident that some slow progress has been
made to adjust international institutions and regimes to meet the new demands and
to create workarounds, if not new frameworks. It is our view that such efforts are unlikely to suffice if global governance, structures and processes continue to ignore
the changes in the balance of power in the international system; a move that will
obliterate completely these insignificant efforts. Therefore, we concur with Jang et
al (2016:1) that the future of global governance will be anchored on individual
empowerment, increasing awareness of human security, institutional complexity,
international power shifts and the liberal world political paradigm.","international organizations; global governance; globalization; sustainable development

International organizations_A comparative approach to the management of cooperation.pdf,"As the number of complex transnational problems have continued to grow, so too
has the desire to combat them through global partnerships and collective action. In response,
the United Nations (U.N.) and member states created the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in
2015. This study provides a background on international organizations and efforts in collectively
moving towards sustainable development goals. It examines the SDGs (specific emphasis on
Food–Energy–Water (FEW) Nexus) and means of governance and implementation at the global level.
It also seeks to describe and visualize partnerships and collective action using network analysis
tools and techniques. The network visualization demonstrates the organizations working together
and towards the SDGs, which provides the type of structure and key actors and arrangements for
implementation at the global stage.",,"This article reviewed where we are in terms of coordination of UN agencies in implementing the
agreed upon SDGs after 5 years. Still a substantial effort is needed in examining SDGs and how they
are reported and evaluated. Action taken by the U.N., Secretary General, and member states since the
adoption of the SDGs has included reforming and realigning the internal organization coordination
and external, in-country support mechanisms for the SDGs. This research also showed how the
numerous programs, funds, and specialized agencies are working together through collective action
partnerships and illustrates the structure and governance of the networks. Yet, 5 years after the passage
of the SDGs, global actors acknowledge that more must be done to reach the goals by the year 2030.
In September 2019 and as part of the 2020 priorities, the Secretary General called on all members and
sectors of society to mobilize and accelerate solutions for the ‘Decade of Action’ (United Nations 2020a). Such collective action relies extensively on partnerships due to the complex, transnational problems
addressed by the SDGs. Further, innovative solutions that consider the integrated nature of resources
and specific goals, such as the FEW nexus, can help to reduce tradeoffs and decision making in silos.
As was introduced at the beginning of this paper and evidenced throughout, sustainable
development has been elevated on the global stage as arguably the most critical modern challenge
facing humanity and the planet. The SDGs are the latest and most comprehensive guidelines to eliminate
previous decades of undesirable and inequitable patterns of economic, social, and environmental
treatment and development. This study contributes to the literature on sustainability by understanding
and reinforcing the critical role of partnerships for the SDGs, network governance in implementing the
SDGs, collective action at the global level, and the key actors in the global network. Of course, there are
some limitations with this research, primarily due to the availability of data for the networks and
partnerships. While the reports and documents for DESA were consistent, there was some question on
the validity of the SDG data. The only document or website that could be located to gather data on the
specific organizations working toward the individual goals was from the Sustainable Development
Goals website. While some organizations may be more involved or central to the networks (such as
the World Trade Organization and U.N. Environmental Programme), we believe overall the results
captured many of the core interorganizational players and actors for the SDGs and helped to provide a
visual representation of them and the key role of partnerships for the goals.","Sustainable Development Goals; network governance; partnerships; collective action;

Network Governance for Collective Action in Implementing United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.pdf,"The past few years have witnessed a growing interest among scholars and policy-makers
in the interplay of international bureaucracies with civil society organizations, non-profit
entities, and the private sector. Authors concerned with global environmental politics
have made considerable progress in capturing this phenomenon. Nevertheless, we still
lack in-depth empirical knowledge on the precise nature of such institutional interlinkages
across governance levels and scales. Building upon the concept of orchestration, this arti-
cle focuses on the relationship between specific types of international bureaucracies and
actors other than the nation-state. In particular, we investigate how the secretariats of the
three Rio Conventions reach out to non-state actors in order to exert influence on the out-
come of international environmental negotiations. Our analysis demonstrates that the three
intergovernmental treaty secretariats utilize various styles of orchestration in their relation
to non-state actors and seek to push the global responses to the respective transboundary
environmental problems forward. This article points to a recent trend towards a direct col-
laboration between these secretariats and non-state actors which gives rise to the idea that
new alliances between these actors are emerging in global environmental governance.",,"To conclude, intergovernmental treaty secretariats aim to enhance the overall effective-
ness of global environmental governance by initiating and strengthening actions carried
out by various kinds of non-state actors (van Asselt and Zelli 2014; Chan et al. 2015). This
interplay between secretariats and non-state actors seems to partly mature towards a divi-
sion of labour (Betsill et al. 2015). Taking the deficiencies of existing global governance
frameworks into account, this development bears important policy implications. When it
comes to addressing transboundary environmental problems, international bureaucracies
can steer the initiatives of non-state actors towards coherence and good practice and at the
same time benefit from their input and expertise. This is especially relevant for policy areas
that exhibit collective action dilemmas, wicked problems, and diverging interests amongst
powerful actors (e.g. Abbott and Hale 2014). International bureaucracies might hence miti-
gate political gridlock by rallying support from transnational and sub-national actors or
turning to non-state actors in order to mobilize advocacy, create demonstration effects, or
otherwise nudge national governments towards more ambitious international agreements
(Abbott 2014). Thus, there is a great potential for the further evolution of such new alli-
ances between international bureaucracies and non-state actors in global (environmental)
policy-making.",,

New coalitions for global governance- the changing dynamics of multilateralism.pdf,"The formal access of transnational actors (TNA) to international organiza-

normative implications of these developments. However, very little is

explains the chronological development of two populations of TNAs in

On transnational actor participation in global environmental governance.pdf,"This paper develops a conceptual framework for analyzing orchestration, a mode of
governance that is widely used by international organizations (IGOs) and other governance
actors, but rarely identified or analyzed. IGOs engage in orchestration when they enlist
intermediary actors on a voluntary basis, by providing them with ideational and material
support, to address target actors in pursuit of IGO governance goals. Orchestration is thus
both indirect (because the IGO acts through intermediaries) and soft (because the IGO lacks
control over intermediaries). These features distinguish orchestration from traditional
hierarchical governance, which addresses targets directly through hard instruments; from
governance through collaboration with targets, which is direct but soft; and from delegation,
which is indirect but hard. The paper elaborates the concept of orchestration, identifies
patterns and techniques of orchestration, and advances hypotheses regarding the conditions
under which governance actors in general and IGOs in particular can be expected to rely on
orchestration.",,,,
Orchestration_Global governance through intermediaries.pdf,"The institutions of global governance have changed dramatically in recent
years. New organizational forms—including informal institutions, transgovernmental
networks, and private transnational regulatory organizations (PTROs)—have expanded
rapidly, while the growth of formal intergovernmental organizations has slowed.
Organizational ecology provides an insightful framework for understanding these
changing patterns of growth. Organizational ecology is primarily a structural theory, em-
phasizing the influence of institutional environments, especially their organizational
density and resource availability, on organizational behavior and viability. To demon-
strate the explanatory value of organizational ecology, we analyze the proliferation of
PTROs compared with the relative stasis of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs).
Continued growth of IGOs is constrained by crowding in their dense institutional
environment, but PTROs benefit from organizational flexibility and low entry costs,
which allow them to enter “niches” with limited resource competition. We probe the
plausibility of our analysis by examining contemporary climate governance.",,"In all these settings, though, analysts will still find it valuable to think, as organi-
zational ecology does, in terms of populations. They will still find structural features
such as institutional density, niches, resource availability, and conditions of compe-
tition important. They will also look to the intrinsic characteristics of organizational
forms that shape environments and influence their impact on individual organiza-
tions, including entry costs, birth and death rates, and flexibility. Organizational
ecology does not answer, certainly not definitively, all questions of future organiza-
tional design and behavior; it must be complemented by the micro-foundations pro-
vided by agent-centered theories. Where this is done, however, organizational
ecology is a valuable addition to the international relations toolbox.",,

Organizational Progeny. Why Governments are Losing Control over the Proliferating Structures of Global Governance.pdf,,,"NGO s are omnipresent in the policy and administrative process of UN organisa-

into the process. W ithout attributing either a positive or negative value to NGO
activity, it can nevertheless be recognised as a factor in global governance. Yet
this phenomenon, contrary to the conventional assum ptions about the virtually

Post-Treaty Politics_Secretariat Influence in Global Environmental Governance.pdf,"The growing importance of the private sector, and its strengthened role in
relation to the public sector, has been central to contemporary analyses of
politics and public policy. This has led to abundant literature on privatisation at
the national level, most notably in the US, the UK and, more recently, the
countries with economies in transition in eastern and central Europe. The term
privatisation has been used commonly to describe the transfer of ownership of
an enterprise or of the means of production from the public (state) sector to the
private (market) sector. 1 In addition, privatisation can be defined in a broader
sense to refer to the rolling back of the social and economic activities of the state.
According to LeGrand and Robinson, these activities can be categorised as the
state provision of goods and services, subsidies and regulations. 2 Cook and
Kirkpatrick write that there are three types of privatisation: changes in owner-
ship of state enterprises; liberalisation and deregulation; and franchising or
contracting out. 3
This paper argues that privatisation at the national level, defined broadly as
above, has led to a process of privatisation at the international level in the
United Nations (UN). While this process is not discernible in the entire UN
system, and certainly not in the Security Council, the General Assembly and the
Secretariat, it is nonetheless observable in certain UN forums. While
""ownership"" of the UN, in the sense of formal membership and voting powers,
remains in the hands of governments, private companies are increasingly
influencing decisions and activities that are nominally the prerogative of govern-
ments.",,"In conclusion, the intention of this study has not been to attack state-centrism
in the study of international relations; there have been many such critiques and
it has not been considered necessary to rehearse them here. But it remains
necessary to extend critiques of state-centrism to the study of intergovernmental
forums where private sector interests are represented on decision-making bodies
to an extent unrecognised in the present literature. The structure of interests
analysed in this study, and the status bestowed upon them by the UN system,
should be seen as a key component of power relations in the post-war order.
This has important implications for the legitimacy of the UN system, the
interests it represents and the ways in which such interests are held accountable.
While governments of member states can, in principle at least, be held account-
able by their populations for policies taken in the international arena, this is not
the case for private companies. At present, telecommunications, maritime ship-
ping and the trade in tropical timber, far from being regulated by intergovern-
mental regimes, are now essentially self-regulated private spheres. There is thus
a need to expand further our understanding of the UN, as the patterns of
influence exposed in this paper do not bode well for the emergence of an
egalitarian global civil society. Rather, they suggest the growing influence of a
transnational managerial class whose interests lie in the expansion of global
capitalism. If priorities other than the pursuit of neoliberalism—such as equi-
table access, safety at sea, the prevention of maritime pollution and tropical
forest conservation—are to be given comparable consideration, a more open,
transparent and accountable system of global governance would seem necessary.",,
REFORMING GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE- FROM UNEP TOWARDS A WORLD ENVIRONMENT ORGANIZATION_Biermann.pdf,,,"In this chapter, I have argued that the establishment of a World
Environment Organization would improve coordination of global
environmental governance; would pave the way for the elevation of
environmental policies on the agenda of governments, international
organizations and private organizations; assist in developing the capacities
for environmental policy in African, Asian and Latin American countries;
and strengthen the institutional environment for the negotiation of new
conventions and action programs as well as for the implementation and
coordination of existing ones. Naturally, a WEO as outlined above cannot
solve all problems of environmental degradation, but can only be a partial
contribution. Yet this should not, I believe, result in a rejection of reform
with the argument that improved governance is not “a puzzle of
administrative efficiency [but] a challenge of global justice” and that global
cooperation is not “a function of inappropriately designed organizations
[but] a reflection of a fundamental absence of willingness on the part of
states.” 34 It is, in most cases, both. Limited reform steps, such as
improved regime design or more effective international agencies, will be
influenced by the larger context of state power and global inequalities in
the same way in which implementing major reforms requires solving
myriad smaller questions. Analysts of global governance need to focus on
the bigger questions, but also on the details—including the underlying
organizational structure of global environmental governance.
Of course, in the end, the key issue is less organizational design and
more the political will of governments regarding how much authority and
resources they wish to grant international organizations. 35 However,
analysts can offer institutional formats through which decision-makers
could best organize and coordinate their policies on international
environmental issues. If governments chose to integrate various
convention secretariats into a WEO, turf-battles would certainly emerge, 36
but these can be overcome if governments wish to do so, since it is
governments who remain the principals of organizations, programs and
conferences of the parties The resistance to any streamlining effort by interested actors—including
the heads of the various convention secretariats, who are likely to lose
influence - is a practical problem rather than a theoretical obstacle to
delineating a mandate for a world environment organization. A WEO
would not solve all problems, neither of industrialized countries nor of
developing countries. But it would be an important institutional step in
humankind’s efforts to both equitably and effectively manage planet
Earth.",,
Relations Between International Organisations_.pdf,,,"As the previous section has shown, inter-organisational interactions in the fi eld
of climate governance are vast and diverse. Compared to other policy areas,
these relations are more dense and numerous, which becomes clear when com-
paring this to other chapters of this Handbook. This chapter does not explore
the specifi c and detailed driving factors for the adoption of individual initia-
tives and joint projects. It can however be concluded that the characteristics of
climate change make it an issue that is highly palatable to inter-organisational
relations. The nature of the issue of climate change as a highly complex one
that transcends most other policy areas seems to provide an explanation for
this observation. Climate change affects and is affected by most other human
and natural activities. Agricultural, economic, social, developmental, scien-
tifi c and many other issues are affected by and contribute to climate change.
They can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This issue interlinkage lies at the source of the complex web of inter-organisational rela-
tions. The salience and urgency of the problem of climate change is a second
contributing factor to explaining why a large number of international organ-
isations engage in various related activities.
This chapter provided an overview of the complex landscape of climate
inter-organisational interaction. It illustrated that the climate organisational
complex is of largely collaborative nature with one core organisation, the
UNFCCC, and a large number of other organisations that address different
aspects of climate change that relate to their core objective such as health,
human rights and migration. The largely collaborative fragmentation can be an
opportunity but also a problem. While some authors consider regime complex-
ity and fragmentation an opportunity because it provides for greater fl exibility
and adaptability (Keohane and Victor 2011 ), others take a more critical stance
and consider fragmentation problematic. It can create opportunities for actors
to engage in selective participation so as to avoid some provisions and foster
their own interests (Gehring and Faude 2014 , p. 476; Orsini 2013 , p. 36; Van
de Graaf 2013 ). Empirical evidence exists for both points of view and further
research could contribute to generating more insights into this challenging
puzzle.
While an extensive web of interaction amongst various organisations has
emerged, the depth and intensity of these inter-organisational relations remain
relatively light and superfi cial. The system is loosely integrated, including uni-
lateral climate activities, inter-organisational information exchange but also
some closer cooperation in the form of joint programmes. The UNFCCC is
the hub of this system. Interplay management is also the objective of the UN
System CEB, which has established a Working Group on Climate Change.
The inter-organisational interaction in global climate governance was only
sketched by using exemplary evidence. This topic provides a vast fi eld for fur-
ther research inspired by network theories and methods. While there is a grow-
ing body of literature on the interplay between two or few institutions, analyses
of the overarching climate architecture and its degree of inter-organisational
relations and fragmentation have not been conducted so far (Zelli 2011 ,
pp. 263–264), which bears some potential for future research.",,
Rethinking international environmental regimes_what role for partnership coalitions.pdf,,"This article addresses these queries by clarifying the nature of
partnership coalitions within the mix of solutions that special regimes
might use for managing the global environment. The second section sets
out the nature of the regimes that are available as multilateral regulatory
mechanisms for effecting environmental protection and management. In
this regard, Section III addresses the notion of partnerships—or like-
minded coalitions of groups—as instruments for implementing these
regimes at the sub-national level. In doing so, the analysis treats both
the advantages of resorting to partnerships for regime implementation at
the local level, as well as the encumbrances they bring as pieces of the global regulatory puzzle. Finally, the article concludes by assessing the
place of partnerships as a practical means for implementing those
regimes already in place.","In a grand sense, the creation of sub-national partnerships
appears consonant with the goal of managing through legally-created
regimes a particular environmental problem or region. Bringing together
numerous governments, international agencies, sub-national groups,
and private sector parties that might act in concert to foster policies and
activities for environmental protection and management seems
desirable, particularly at the national level. Yet, fostering transnational
partnerships poses multiple difficulties, not only in terms of logistics but
also with respect to philosophies. Partnerships may assist in bridging
gaps between multilateral regime agreements and the principal local
problems they seek to remedy. In sum, partnerships may aspire to spark
non-governmental and private sector participation in implementing
international environmental regimes. Serious obstacles, however,
impede the reality of this happening effectively. Scant financing for
partnerships is available from new sources. Most is allocated from
governments and less than one per cent from the private sector. Concern
over partnerships also persists because these coalitions are seen as
possibly reducing pressure on governments to fulfill legal commitments
made in the construction of a regime. In any event, until all major
participants—governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-
governmental organizations, and multinational corporations—invest
more resources in partnership coalitions, their role in redressing
environmental problems will remain more passive than active in effect
and their impacts more ancillary than revolutionary in scope.",,
Taking responsive regulation transnational_Strategies for international organizations.pdf,"Responsive Regulation (RR) introduced important new ways of thinking about regulation. But RR
was designed for domestic settings in which a single agency had clear jurisdiction, full regulatory
capacity, and extensive information, and could (contingently) deploy stringent sanctions against
well-defined targets. Under globalization, many regulatory problems have shifted to the transna-
tional arena, characterized by multiple regulators, public and private, with limited capacities,
authority, and information, and modest sanctioning ability; globalized production also renders the
targets of regulation diffuse and difficult to identify. RR holds important lessons for transnational
regulation, but it must be adapted to these challenging conditions. Some components of transna-
tional RR are already emerging, including numerous private and public–private schemes that
regulate business through voluntary norms: “transnational regulatory standard-setting” (TRSS).
Alone, however, TRSS schemes face serious limitations. Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)
are best positioned to “take RR transnational” by supporting and working with the nascent TRSS
system. Two regulatory strategies are particularly promising: collaboration and orchestration. In
“regulatory collaboration,” IGOs promote business self-regulation, much as in RR; they can escalate
in response to defection by deploying reputational and market sanctions. In “orchestration,” IGOs
support and steer intermediaries, including TRSS schemes and NGOs, which use their material and
ideational capacities to regulate target behavior. Orchestration cumulates regulatory competencies,
creates avenues of escalation, and provides many benefits of RR “tripartism.”",,"Regulatory collaboration and orchestration are essential strategies for transnational regu-
lation. Yet they also expand the general regulatory toolkit, adding innovative strategies
that may be applicable in other contexts. In closing, we point toward two areas in which
orchestration, in particular, might make a valuable contribution to other regulatory
domains.","international organization, orchestration, private regulation, responsive regulation,

The accountability of international organizations.pdf,"As the responsibilities of international organisations (IGOs) have multiplied, so have calls for greater
responsiveness and accountability. Burall and Negligan set forth a four-dimensional accountability
framework for international organisations, whose emphasis is on the ongoing, participative nature of
accountability. Accordingly, IGOs must ensure the participation of internal and external stakeholders,
including civil society and government. They must be transparent, both in disclosing information and in
their decision-making processes. The activities of IGOs must be subject to evaluation by external
agencies and through an internal, self-critical organisational culture. Finally, a complaints and regress
mechanism must supplement the protection of internal “whistleblowers” who uncover abuses of power.
The true challenge, Burall and Negligan conclude, lies in operationalising and implementing these
accountability principles in a manner that reflect the nature and needs of the individual organisations.",,,,
The complexification of the United Nations system.pdf,,,"The growth and elaboration of the UN System during its first half cen-
tury reflects a number of countervailing factors: on the one hand the
need for additional types of activities as the community of states is
confronted more and more frequently and urgently with problems that
require global or at least regional solutions; on the other the concerns of
governments that the international structures already established to deal
with these problems are becoming too many (for practical oversight and
control) and too powerful (sometimes requiring even major states to
yield). The result has been the invention of various hybrid structures:
Quasi-Autonomous Bodies (QABs); Treaty Organs (TOs) that may be
permanent or merely in transition to IGO status; both attached (to the
UN System) and unattached Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs);
joint substantive or administrative organs; temporary organs; and sev-
eral other devices described or at least mentioned above.
The natural fecundity of this essentially need-driven but politics-
controlled process has been quite successful in'creating the many enti-
ties required to carry out the ever-growing though often unacknow-
ledged demand for international governance. But the twists and turns
that are sometimes required to secure agreement for a particular advance
have left the international landscape littered with what in PC (""politi-
cally correct"") terminology should be called ""challenged structures"", i.e.
ones that do not have all the necessary legal components for unambigu-
ous decision making or for the execution of such decisions. Though
with sufficient good will almost any device can be made to work, when
confronted by serious controversy some may not be in a position to re-
spond reliably. And while the morphing of TOs into full-fledged IGOs
may be considered as splendid examples of legal flexibility, there are still
some practical reasons why stability and certainty of juridical forms is
desirable.
It would therefore appear timely to conduct a serious review of what
has been accomplished in the field of international organizational law
since the establishment of the United Nations, examining in particular
the extensive ad hocery of recent years, perhaps with a view to codify-
ing and enhancing that which has proven to be successful and, without
attempting to restore the pristine simplicity of the original design, dis-
carding or reformulating some of the less fortunate experiments.
Having said this, it should be recognized that essentially interna-
tional organizations are flourishing — perhaps to the regret of some —
in response to multiple demands, often not clearly expressed, by the in-
ternational community. The protean life force resulting from that de-
mand is responsible for both the observed growth and for the increasing
complexity of the United Nations System. The challenge is to harness
that force so that complexification does not lead to an impenetrable or-
ganizational jungle but rather enhances the flexibility of the System to
respond to the increasing need for world governance.",,
The Emergent _System_ of Global Environmental Governance.pdf,"t is about time that the literature on global environmental governance moves
beyond its myopic obsession with whether or not a new environmental super-
structure is needed. 1 Given that at least one of us stands guilty of having contrib-
uted to the unending ªxation with the debate on organizational tinkering, this
should not be seen as criticism but as confession. Thankfully, there is now a stir-
ring of movement towards a broader discourse that begins to take into account
the multiplicity of actors and interactions involved in meaningful global gover-
nance. 2 Peter Haas and Mukul Sanwal 3 do a service by nudging the discourse
forward and pointing out that a multidimensional “system” of global environ-
mental governance is, in fact, already taking shape.",,"A nascent “system” of global environmental governance does exist, even if it is
rather messy. Although there is no real reason to make the system less messy, it
can be made more effective by taking a number of steps that would (a) support
the positive trends already apparent in the emergent system (b) strengthen the system as it evolves, and (c) articulate a clear vision for the eventual system that
we wish to move towards.
Figure 2 highlights our key proposals in each of the three areas. Our pro-
posals do not seek to dramatically change the system by imagining new super-
organizations for the environment. Instead, they build upon the positive syner-
gies that already exist within the system. They are designed to be “doable” as
well as “manageable” and have an implicit timeframe associated with them: the
ªrst set of proposals can be put in place in the immediate-term, the second in
the medium-term, while the third set of proposals relate to a vision for the even-
tual system which can only unfold slowly and over the long-term.",,
The global governance of international development- Documenting the rise of multi-stakeholder partnerships and identifying underlying theoretical explanations.pdf,"The global governance of development increasingly relies on multi-stakeholder partnerships
between states, intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations. This article
takes on two tasks. The first is to describe quantitatively the institutional evolution of the multilateral
development system over the past century. The second is to juxtapose four rational-institutionalist
explanations for why states establish new organizations as transnational governance initiatives—
functionalism, power-oriented theories, domestic politics, and contextual design. The empirical
analysis probes these explanations using the new Transnational Governance Initiatives in World
Politics dataset, which combines several existing data sources to build the most comprehensive data on
forms of institutionalized cooperation in global governance. The results lend most support to the
contextual design view, while also yielding support for other accounts. By employing Heckman
selection models, the analysis addresses potential selection bias due to unobserved correlation between
state choices to create a new organization and its design. A qualitative case study further validates
measurement choices and causal mechanisms. These findings have implications for theories of
institutional design and development practice, specifically regarding the role of intergovernmental
organizations in an increasingly interconnected world.",,"Finally, the rise of TGIs prompts debates about whether the state has lost its role in global
politics at the expense of private actors (Avant, Finnemore, and Sell 2010; Büthe 2004; Hall
and Biersteker 2002; Kahler and Lake 2003). Our analysis showed that states remain key
actors but no longer are the only actors in institutional design. In the IFCS case, states
controlled the organizational design decisions, as they watered down the IMCRAM proposal
put forward by IGO bureaucrats. As others have shown, bureaucratic influence over
organizational design thus is limited to cases where states have no salient interests; where
they lack expertise; or where they are late to the process (Johnson 2014; Johnson and
Urpelainen 2014; Seddon 2017). As a result of an increasingly crowded multilateral
development system, however, states are ever less able to control the dynamic implications of
TGI formation. Once created, TGIs push forward new issues, as non-state actors have great
say in them by design. States thus risk being entrapped into escalating commitments. These
dynamics would again be a fascinating area for future research beyond individual case
studies.","global governance; multilateral development organizations; aid architecture; informal

The globalisation of environmental law- the role of the United Nations.pdf,"This paper discusses the changes that have taken place in environmental regulation over the past
twenty years, focussing on the moves towards recognition ofthe connection between environmental
and developmental policies, and the interdependence of global ecosystems and economies. Recent
developments in International Environmental Law are discussed, in particular the impact of the
instruments generated through the UN Conference on Environment and Development. The new
orthodoxy ofsustainable development is then considered, with emphasis placed on the possibilities of
implementation. The role of regional organisations is discussed, as well as the role of existing and
future international institutions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the draji International
Covenant on Environment and Development, and some practical implications of globalisation for
relevant United Nations organisations.",,"The process of globalisation of environmental law and policy seems set to
continue apace for the immediate future. The role of United Nations agencies in
managing this process is a crucial one. The dangers of homogenisation of
environmental legal mechanisms need constantly to be borne in mind, to ensure
that consistency of approach does not bring with it a wholesale swamping of
cultural values and social structures through the influence, in particular, of
Western values and economic structures.
The expectations, great or otherwise, of the international community in rela-
tion to the role of the United Nations in the field of environmental law and
policy might be surnrnarised as follows:
The roles of UNEP and UNDP need to be rationalised and made consistent. It
makes little sense for each body to promote sustainable development from
what have been different starting points - one from the point of view of the
right to global environment protection, the other from the point of view of the
right to development. The lesson of sustainable development is that, both
conceptually and practically, environmental concerns and economic aspira-
tions need to be integrated. This must mean that at least the work pro-grammes of these two bodies should be made consistent at country if not
regional level, even if there is no agreement about institutional integration. In
any case, the Charters of these two bodies need to be re-examined in order to
address the need for integration.
It also seems sensible for the CSD to collaborate more closely with UNEP as
well as UNDP. The roles and functions of each of these bodies seem to overlap
to an extent, but the expertise developed through one body can clearly be of
practical use and benefit in the work of the others.
There is a need to think more clearly about the processes of implementation
and enforcement of environmental conventions. Secretariats of the conven-
tions which have similar subject areas should be encouraged to work closely
with each other.88 There is also a need to explore the possibilities of new
institutions for implementation and enforcement, and whether such a body or
bodies should arise from the present institutions or whether there should be a
new organisation. The Economic Security Council, suggested by the Com-
mission on Global Governance, is one such vehicle, but its proposed role
should be expanded to reflect more truly the concept of sustainable develop-
ment through integration of economic and environmental concerns.
There is also a need to think about alternative ways of encouraging implemen-
tation of and compliance with environmental conventions, including the
expansion of the mandate of the Global Environment Facility and ensuring
that adequate funds are provided for it.
The obligations proposed in the Draft International Covenant on Environment
and Development of 1995 are likely to engender an intense debate about the
direction of international environmental law, and in particular will underline
the vigour with which the globalisation of environmental regulation is being
pursued.
The establishment or strengthening of regional bodies for implementation for
both regional and global environmental conventions needs to be considered.
Finally, there is a need to re-emphasise the integral relationship between
international and national environmental law, and to remember that, particu-
larly in this field, international law is virtually useless unless it is adequately
and consistently implemented at a national
The task of integration
and further development of international and national environmental law is
quintessentially a task for UNEP and other UN agencies, working closely in
association with other relevant bodies and institutions working in this area.9",,
The impact of the Sustainable Development Goals on a network of 276 international organizations.pdf,"Global sustainability governance is marked by a highly fragmented system of distinct clusters of international
organizations, along with states and other actors. Enhancing inter-organizational coordination and cooperation is
thus often recognized as an important reform challenge in global sustainability governance. The 17 Sustainable
Development Goals, agreed by the United Nations in 2015, thus explicitly aim at advancing policy coherence and
institutional integration among the myriad international institutions. Yet, have these goals been effective in this
regard? We assess here the impact of the Sustainable Development Goals on the network structure of 276 in­
ternational organizations in the period 2012–2019, that is, four years before and four years after the launch of
the Sustainable Development Goals. The network structure was approximated by analyzing data from the
websites of these 276 international organizations that were joined by more than 1.5 million hyperlinks, which we
collected using a custom-made web crawler. Our findings are contrary to what is widely expected from the
Sustainable Development Goals: we find that fragmentation has in fact increased after the Sustainable Devel­
opment Goals came into effect. In addition, silos are increasing around the 17 SDGs as well as around the social,
economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.",,,"Our study shows that since the implementation of the SDGs, frag­
mentation among international organizations has not decreased.
Instead, siloization has increased around the 17 SDG issue areas as well
as around the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sus­
tainable development. International organizations are central to
addressing the issues encompassed in the SDGs (Cormier, 2018; Sachs,
2006; Stiglitz, 2008), and the consequences of continued siloization
could be severe. Working in silos may hamper the exchange of novel
ideas and knowledge amongst international organizations that is
required to deal with the complex and globally interconnected problems
that the SDGs aim to address, and it might limit options for joint stan­
dards, policies, and transformative norm development (Bodin, 2017;
Borgatti and Halgin, 2011; Burt, 2004). Moreover, such effects may
trickle down to the national level because of the significant role that
international organizations have in shaping domestic policies in many
countries (Abbott and Bernstein, 2015; Cormier, 2018; Tosun and Pe­
ters, 2018).
While the eventual impact of the SDGs can only be assessed towards
the end of their implementation period—that is, by 2030—recent data
suggest that the world is not on track to achieve them. Progress on many
targets has stalled or reversed (UN, 2021). In the end, the onus is on
political actors at all levels to implement the goals. A reduction of
fragmentation and siloization, at all levels of global sustainability
governance and cutting across policy areas, is indispensable in achieving
the SDGs (Biermann and Kanie, 2017; Gupta and Nilsson, 2017). Our
study has shown that, so far, the opposite is happening.",
The institutional design of funding rules at inernational organisations_Explaining the transformation in financing the UN.pdf,"What explains the design and development of funding rules at international
organizations? I investigate this question in the context of the United Nations system,
which has undergone a dramatic shift in financing. Long associated with mandatory
contributions, the United Nations increasingly relies on voluntary resources earmarked
by individual donors. Previous studies have investigated the financing puzzle from a
behavioral perspective and have found that wealthy donors use voluntary funding to
rein in costs and constrain international organization programs. Providing an alternative
theoretical approach, I investigate the financing puzzle from an institutional design
perspective. I provide original United Nations funding rule data to demonstrate that it
is not only funding practices, but also underlying funding rules, that have changed over
time. I theorize how states with favorable views of the United Nations that sought to
expand its activities — rather than those that desired to constrain it — had incentives
to introduce funding rules that offered more flexibility and control to donors. I test
the argument with a longitudinal case study of funding rule design and change at United
Nations economic development institutions. The article expands the institutional design
literature by integrating funding rules as a consequential design component and provides
a novel explanation for changes in United Nations financing.",,"The remarkable shift in the financing of the UN and other IOs has drawn attention from
policymakers and IR scholars. To date, scholarship has trained attention on donor fund-
ing choices to explain the shift, taking for granted contemporary funding rules that pro-
vide an array of options for donors. This article makes clear that such an approach
provides an incomplete picture of why and how the transformation occurred. New UN
funding rule data reveal that it is not only donor practices, but also the underlying fund-
ing rules, that have changed over time. It is often assumed that powerful states with a
preference to constrain UN programming and rein in costs are responsible for these
trends. However, the analysis here demonstrates that such rules were initially designed
by actors willing to finance the UN at higher levels and expand its activity into new
areas. Flexible funding rules provided states with progressive preferences the opportu-
nity to expand UN activity in a context in which the larger membership was divided. This
had important implications for the development of the UN system. Without the innova-
tion of voluntary funding rules, it is unlikely that many UN programs that we know today
would have been created. However, voluntary rules also facilitated the increased control
of individual donors over UN programming decisions, and subsequently empowered
wealthy actors to translate financial support into influence more easily than they could
under the mandatory funding system. As a result, concerns that the authority of multilat-
eral decision-making associated with UN governing bodies is undermined by donor deci-
sions have become widespread (Graham, 2015).
The article expands the scope of the institutional design literature by introducing
funding rules as a consequential and overlooked design component and outlining how
funding rules relate to important dimensions of design already discussed in the literature.
Mandatory funding rules involve a rigid commitment that states are willing to take on
only when they expect that IO governing bodies will make programming choices they
support at costs they find affordable. Divergent member state preferences make flexibil-
ity desirable, providing states with an insurance policy against undesirable financial
commitments. Voluntary, and especially restricted voluntary, funding rules also enhance
donor control, allowing member states to provide aid through an IO without ceding con-
trol over how its contribution will be used.
Although the transformation in UN financing provides the motivating puzzle for the
article, the theoretical framework is relevant to other IOs within and outside the broader
UN system. First, increased reliance on restricted, voluntary resources is not confined to
the UN proper, and funding rule design remains hotly contested in treaty negotiations. Many UN specialized agencies have undergone transformations in financing similar to
those documented in the UN proper. Funding rule design has proven controversial at
institutions governed by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, where
industrialized states insist on flexible funding mechanisms to finance mitigation and
adaptation activities and developing states demand mandatory financing. Second, the
insight that smaller states with progressive preferences have incentives to introduce more
flexible funding rules that offer greater donor control may shed new light on why IOs
with weighted voting rules experience increased reliance on restricted, voluntary funds.
Whereas the most powerful states have the ability to influence programming at these
institutions through formal votes, other states have incentives to make use of funding
mechanisms that offer greater control in order to pursue their priorities.
The topic of IO financing is ripe for future research. Beyond testing hypotheses on
design in other cases, scholarship should analyze the effects of restricted resources on IO
activity. In addition, the emphasis on state preferences should be expanded to consider
the preferences and influence of IO staff in the development of funding rules and prac-
tices. The importance of IO staff is particularly relevant in light of recent efforts by staff
at the UN and other IOs to reduce reliance on restricted resources.","Global governance, institutional design, intergovernmental organization, international

The Politics of International Environmental Management.pdf,"Global environmental governance in the Anthropocene is fundamentally different from older
conceptions of environmental policy-making and sustainable development. Environmental
problem-solving is no longer concerned with isolated problems, but rather with reorganising
the overall relation between humans and natural systems. Empirically, this is reflected in the
ever greater attention to questions of institutional interactions (e.g. between the issue areas of
economics and environment) and functional overlaps between parallel governance approaches.
Normatively, environmental governance in the Anthropocene is concerned with questions of
equity and fairness on a finite planet. This article scrutinises the theoretical interregnum in global
environmental governance by first sketching the key empirical trends in global environmental
governance; secondly, discussing theory-building with regards to four broad areas of inquiry: the
questions of agency and authority; the structural dimension of global environmental governance;
the related normative questions about legitimacy, accountability, equity and fairness in the
Anthropocene; and finally the integration of governance research into formal approaches and the
related incorporation of non-social science concepts into environmental governance research. In
our conclusions, we propose some initial ideas on how to move forward in the study of global
(environmental) governance.",,"In sum, our analysis of current trends and topics in theorising global environmental gov-
ernance in the Anthropocene has presented not a unified and consolidated but a

The Quest for a United Nations Specialised Agency for the Environment.pdf,"Many of the major policy challenges facing governments today are in some sense
collective problems, calling for joint solutions. This also applies to the issue-area
of environmental management, and to Europe at least as much as to any other region.
However, even when effective solutions can only be reached through joint efforts,
voluntary cooperation seems quite often to be hard to establish and maintain. This
makes it all the more important to be able to understand the conditions for 'success'
and the causes of 'failure' in international environmental problem-solving.
This volume addresses some aspects of that general question. We shall pursue our
theme through three consecutive stages of the policy process: the formation of the
national policy positions that serve as inputs into international negotiations, the
aggregation of those preferences and positions into joint decisions, and the (domestic)
implementation of international agreements.",,"If we wish to determine whether or not regimes 'matter' - i.e. whether they have
independent influence on state behavior, or whether international agreements amount
to more than ink on paper - we need to trace carefully the processes, structures
and values at the national level which determine the manner in which such agree-
ments are carried out and responded to. We cannot focus exclusively on the structure
of the interstate game, looking for the constraints upon state behavior that would encourage compliance with international contracts. To the extent that an analysis
of international regimes ignores domestic political processes, it will not be able to
show the way in which regimes actually influence policy choices at the opera-
tional level. Thereby it closes off one important avenue for examining questions
of regime effectiveness. Nor will we be able to understand how the positions nations
take and defend in international negotiations leading to the agreement come about
without considering the way in which international negotiations both mobilize and
penetrate domestic society.
Much of what we have said about the domestication of international commitments
is, admittedly, quite familiar. What we have tried to do is raise the question as to
whether the internationalization of domestic concerns does involve a qualitatively
different set of issues, structures and processes than what traditionally has occupied
foreign policy analysts and policy-makers. Second, since the domestic functional
ministries, in their international activities, and foreign affairs policy-making system,
are intertwined (if they are not, in fact, two sides of the same coin) in both for-
mulating and defending (negotiating) national positions, it is important to examine
the decision-making structures and processes through which they and the societal
interests they 'represent' are linked in taking decisions at the domestic and inter-
national levels. And, third, the game is not over when the ink on the treaty or
agreement has been blotted. At that point the implementation process begins through
which the ultimate 'bottom line' of the commitment will be achieved in the behavior
and activities of groups and individuals in the societies of signatory nations. And
this implementation of lEAs will involve a complex web of international, trans-
governmental, transnational and national (both public and private) interactions which
makes it difficult to grasp only in terms of enforcement and compliance. Management
tasks in connection with both the negotiation and the implementation of interna-
tional commitments must be fulfilled at all these levels.
Whatever the structure of this management network and whichever the specific
activities that are channeled through it, focussing on the problems and opportuni-
ties of achieving effective international cooperation makes abundantly clear that
deliberate defection from these contracted obligations may very well be the least
of our worries.",,
The two faces of the United Nations- The tension between intergovernmentalism and transnationalism_Bruce  .pdf,"Recent years have seen intense intergovernmental deliberations on issues concerning
governance in the ﬁeld of environment. Their aim has been to address the role of the institutions
that provide platforms for international environmental cooperation. There are two main lines of
enquiry: the role of regime-speciﬁc institutions that cater to sectoral regulatory frameworks
(popularly known as multilateral environmental agreements, or MEAs); and the role of insti-
tutions that are established to follow up on global environmental conferences or a speciﬁc
environmental task. Most of these institutions reﬂect intergovernmental consensual process.
However, there are concerns about their proliferation and there is a growing cacophony of calls to
‘bring coherence to the fragmented landscape of MEAs, intergovernmental bodies, UN system
entities and other international organizations’ (Sha Zukang (2011) ‘Legal and policy dimensions
of sustainable development: expected contribution of Rio þ 20’, Environmental Policy and Law,
41(6), pp. 244–246, at p. 245). In fact the need to bring order to environmental governance has
assumed great importance and urgency if environmental cooperation is to be achieved. This paper
explores, in particular, the role of the United Nations Environment Programme and its potential
for conversion to a specialised agency of the UN.",,"There is an urgent need to strengthen the UN’s environmental institutional and
governance framework and to augment coordination in order to address global

The United Nations and Business_Towards New Modes of Global Governance_.pdf,,"re is a tension within the United Nations between intergovern
mentalism and transnationalism, two forces that encompass dif
ferent sets of interests and reflect distinct constituencies. As an
intergovernmental institution, the UN reflects the overlapping interests
of its member states, particularly those on the Security Council. Major
initiatives and policies are promoted by accredited delegations, all of
whom represent their governments. As a transnational organization,
however, the UN also often represents a common good that transcends
the sum of individual state interests. Such concerns are promoted by
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and by the UN's specialized
agencies, affiliated organizations, bureaucracy, and office of the secretary
general. In many cases, transnational concerns such as human rights or
humanitarian relief conflict with the more traditional intergovernmen
tal ones such as security. When this occurs, the UN is unable to function
effectively.
This conflict between intergovernmentalism and transnationalism
reflects a similar tension within the international system itself. Inter
governmentalism is certainly the dominant force in world politics, but
transnational actors have also achieved increased visibility and influ
ence within the global organization. From this perspective, the UN not
only provides a forum for states to resolve their disputes, it also serves
as a medium through which state and nonstate actors promote their
often competing interests. Thus, the conflict between these forces
within the UN can help to illustrate their respective roles in interna
tional politics.
In this article I examine this tension and explore what this may
mean for the future of global politics. Since this is primarily a concep
tual essay, I do not present original data nor examine specific cases in
any detail. Rather my purpose is to identify and explain a phenomenon
and provide a framework through which one can undertake empirical
studies in the future.
In the first section I examine the intergovernmental and transna
tional foundations of the UN system. I argue that while traditional the
ories of international organizations can explain the intergovernmental
side of the UN, they have trouble accounting for the transnational as
pects. In the next section I try to account for this other face of the UN
by suggesting that the UN is not only a forum for interstate cooperation,
but also an institutional embodiment of an ""international community,""
independent of the states that compose it. The benefits that are enjoyed
by this broadly defined community can be viewed as the common good.
In the third section I examine the inherent tension between these two
forces. I argue that when the interests of the states conflict with those of
the broader community, the organization becomes paralyzed. In the last
section I discuss the broader implications of the conflict for theories of
international relations.
In distinguishing between intergovernmental and transnational
functions, I use the following criteria: First, which constituency is being
served in a particular operation or program: the member states, local
populations, nongovernmental interest groups, the ""international com
munity"" as a whole, or regional organizations? I define those programs
that serve primarily nonstate actors as transnational. Second, who are
the primary actors initiating the operation or program: the member
states, specialists within the UN agencies, government representatives
to functional bodies, NGOs, or the UN Secretariat? Those activities that
require the active cooperation and participation of the states are inter
governmental. Those that rely primarily on UN agencies, NGOs, spe
cialized agencies, or the Secretariat are considered transnational. Third,
through what process are state interests defined in a particular issue: do
mestically, through consultation with representatives from other coun
tries, through interaction among specialists or representatives of NGOs,
or by initiation of the secretary-general? Interests that develop through
diplomatic or domestic political channels are intergovernmental, while
those that evolve from within the UN structure are transnational.","From the perspective of IR theory, this suggests a paradox in inter
national relations. IGOs, such as the UN, increasingly assume a wide
range of tasks that their member states lack the competence, will, and/or
technical expertise to perform?for example, peacekeeping. As a result,
the member states are forced to assign many of these responsibilities to
NGOs and other nonstate actors, whose interests and constituencies are
often at odds with those of the states. The larger and more complex
these IGOs become, the more tasks they assume and the more they are
forced to ""contract out"" their services to specialized agencies and
NGOs. The greater the involvement of NGOs within the IGOs, the more
transnational concerns threaten to replace intergovernmental ones on the
organizational agenda. Thus, states dominate the global agenda, but in
ternational organizations such as the UN provide opportunities for non
governmental actors to exercise a level of influence in world politics
that they would otherwise never be able to achieve",,

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat as an orchestrator in global climate policymaking.pdf,"When the United Nations (UN) was founded, environmental issues were not
seen as a significant threat. Now, seventy-five years since the UN first came
into existence, environmental issues, from being of peripheral concern, have become
mainstream and are defining many multilateral deliberations. The growing environ­
mental concerns – particularly since the 1960s – resulted in the emergence of
hundreds of multilateral and bilateral agreements along with international and
national institutions. The contributions of the UN in all these developments were
critical. From Stockholm to Paris, the UN, particularly UNEP and UNFCCC, played
a vital role in making the environmental concerns genuinely global. This Essay
appraises the role and contributions of the UN in the evolution of global environ­
mental governance.
When the United Nations (UN) was founded in 1945 in the backdrop of the
ravages of the Second World War, the core concerns before the delegates of fifty
nations gathered in San Francisco, were peace and security, human rights, and
development. Consequently, the UN Charter had no mention of the word ‘environ­
ment.’ However, today the UN is the foremost forum for setting the global agenda on
environment and promoting sustainable development goals. Since the last five
decades and more, the UN has been delivering leadership, encouraging multiple
partnerships and designing programmes for the protection of the environment. It is
hard to imagine effective responses to environmental problems without a decisive
role of the UN. In the 21 st century with greater interconnection of the geophysical to
the geo-economic and the geopolitical, the environment is now an existential concern
and is increasingly being integrated into almost all the UN programmes as ‘green
mandate.’
This Essay focuses on: the UN as a venue for collective action, including
negotiating global environmental agreements; critical milestone conferences such
as Stockholm (1972), Rio (1992) and Paris (2015); and the role of the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as well as the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Conference of
the Parties (COP). It also looks at how the 75 th anniversary offers a unique
opportunity for the UN to bolster multilateral approaches to environmental
emergencies and restore global confidence in multilateralism.",,"In January 2019, the UN published the first global report on environmental rule of
law. The report focuses on the implementation gap between environmental laws and
regulations and it concurred that since the 1972 UN Conference on Human
Environment (Stockholm Conference), there is a 38-fold increase in environmental
legislation. However, failure to fully implement these laws is one of the most
significant challenges to mitigating climate change. 36 The Stockholm Conference
brought global environment into the public consciousness, leading to the creation of
the UNEP. Following the 1992 Rio Conference, many countries made a concerted
effort to enact environmental laws and establish environment ministries and agen­
cies. Today, more than 175 countries have environmental framework laws, and
roughly 150 countries have enshrined the right to a healthy environment in their
constitutions. Besides, 164 countries have created cabinet-level bodies, responsible
for environmental protection. 37
However, at the global level, since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997,
numerous environmental negotiations have concluded without any significant pro­
gress, underlining the fact that successful implementation cannot be achieved in
isolation or without the collective participation of varied stakeholders. The 2015
Paris Agreement was indeed path-breaking with efforts to create an enabling envir­
onment for development and maintaining a delicate balance of bottom-up and top-
down approaches to protect the environment. The UNEP, UNFCCC and CoP meet­
ings, all have had a significant role in unravelling the complex climate system and
aligning lives and livelihood with the principles of sustainability. However, as
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pointed out in September 2019, the climate
emergency is a race we are still losing. Multilateral cooperation, not only in the
field of climate change but across the range from security to development, is facing
unprecedented crises. Interest-based politics and opportunism are ruling almost all
the multilateral institutions.
The commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the UN is a significant landmark
but also gives an opportunity to ask how the world would deal with the climate
emergency. Carbon dioxide concentration is at its highest (412 parts per million),
a level that last occurred about 3 million years ago. Temperatures have been rising
between 0.2 and 0.4 degrees centigrade per decade, with a current average annual
temperature which is 1.2 degree centigrade higher. The overall carbon in the atmo­
sphere, roughly 47 billion tonnes, remains a burden. The past shows that it is not the
absence of rules and institutions, rather the lack of political will and problems of
coordination and implementation that weakens global climate governance. The
apathy of great powers—particularly the US—towards multilateral climate govern­
ance and the conflict within the UN system among various organs over the roles and
responsibilities have stymied concrete climate action.
Seventy-five years ago, the delegates seized the opportunity for a better world.
As climate change insidiously grips the world in a series of interlinked crises, the
UN, drawing inspiration from its founders, can become a pivot for global climate
governance, based on effective multilateralism and achieving sustainable develop­
ment goals.",,
The United Nations in the 21st Century.pdf,"Scholars have recently devoted increasing attention to the role and function of inter-
national bureaucracies in global policymaking. Some of them contend that international
public officials have gained significant political influence in various policy fields.
Compared to other international bureaucracies, the political leeway of the
Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has
been considered rather limited. Due to the specific problem structure of the policy
domain of climate change, national governments endowed this intergovernmental
treaty secretariat with a relatively narrow mandate. However, this article argues that
in the past few years, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat has gradually loosened its straitjacket and expanded its original spectrum of
activity by engaging different sub-national and non-state actors into a policy dialogue using
facilitative orchestration as a mode of governance. The present article explores the recent
evolution of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat
and investigates the way in which it initiates, guides, broadens and strengthens sub-national
and non-state climate actions to achieve progress in the international climate negotiations.
The Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has
lately adopted new roles and functions in global climate policymaking. While previously
seen as a rather technocratic body that, first and foremost, serves national govern-
ments, the Climate Secretariat increasingly interacts with sub-national governments,
civil society organizations and private companies to push the global response to climate
change forward. We contend that the Climate Secretariat can contribute to global
climate policymaking by coordinating and steering the initiatives of non-nation-state
actors towards coherence and good practice.",,"Building upon the concept of orchestration, this article investigated the UNFCCC
Secretariat as an illustrative case of a facilitative orchestrator. The analysis has
demonstrated how the Secretariat initiates, guides, broadens and strengthens sub-
national and non-state climate actions. By these means, the UNFCCC Secretariat
seeks to achieve progress in the international climate negotiations and to enhance
the overall effectiveness of the global climate governance landscape (Chan et al.,
2015; Van Asselt and Zelli, 2014). In principle, this approach could be expanded in
order to allow sub-national and non-state actors to make a more substantial
impact in global climate policymaking. The main challenge is thereby to design
the UNFCCC process in such a way that the actions of sub-national and non-state
actors ‘become not substitutes or even complements to a global treaty, but step-
ping stones on the path to a higher climate ambition that an effective treaty will
require’ (Hale, 2013: 2).
These ideas bear important policy implications and point to new avenues for
further research. In every policy domain where collective action dilemmas have to
be overcome and the interests of nation-states diverge, international bureaucracies
can contribute to solving trans boundary problems by coordinating and steering
the initiatives of non-nation-state actors towards coherence and good practice (e.g.
Abbott and Hale, 2014). More specifically, when intergovernmental negotiations
get stuck in gridlock – as is currently the case in several issue-areas of global
politics – international bureaucracies might turn to sub-national and non-state
actors in order to mobilize advocacy, create demonstration effects or otherwise
pressure national governments to initiate progress in multilateral treaty-making
(cf. Abbott, 2014). Whether, in the end, these initiatives are successful in setting up
more effective and legitimate international public institutions, however, remains an
open question that warrants further investigation.
From a practical perspective, we contend that there is a great potential for
increased interaction between sub-national and non-state actors and international
bureaucracies. We therefore recommend the further strengthening of the role and
function of the UNFCCC Secretariat, as well as other international public agen-
cies, and opening up the intergovernmental process for the initiatives of sub-
national governments, civil society organizations and private companies in order
to push the global response to pressing trans boundary challenges forward.","climate change, environmental policymaking, intergovernmental relations, international

Transforming governance and institutions for global sustainability- key insights from the_Earth System Governance Project.pdf,"The current institutional framework for sustainable

swift transformative progress that is needed. This article

1972 Stockholm Conference—will not suffice to bring about
societal change at the level and speed needed to mitigate and
adapt to earth system transformation. Instead, the article
argues that transformative structural change in global
governance is needed, and that the 2012 United Nations
Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro
must turn into a major stepping stone for a much stronger
institutional framework for sustainable development. The
article details core areas where urgent action is required. The
article is based on an extensive social science assessment
conducted by 32 members of the lead faculty, scientific
steering committee, and other affiliates of the Earth System

initiative under the auspices of the International Human
Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change

substantial shortcomings in the functioning of the institu-
tional framework for sustainable development. Yet there
are also major opportunities to improve global, national
and local governance, institutions and practices. Incre-
mentalism—the hallmark of the last decades—will not
suffice to bring about societal change at the level and
speed needed to mitigate and adapt to earth system
transformation brought about by human action. Instead,
swift transformative structural change in global governance is
needed. We need a ‘constitutional moment’ in the history
of world politics, akin to the major transformative shift in
governance after 1945 that led to the establishment of the
United Nations and numerous other international organ-
izations, along with far-reaching new international legal
norms on human rights and economic cooperation. Earth
system transformation calls for similar, if not even more
fundamental, transformations in the way societies govern
their affairs.
The 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable
Development must make an important start. Earlier
diplomatic summits—notably 1972 in Stockholm and
1992 in Rio de Janeiro—are today seen as major mile-
stones in the development of global sustainability gov-
ernance. The conferences in 1982 and 2002 have clearly
been less influential. The 2012 Rio Conference offers
both an opportunity and a crucial test of whether the

urgently needed change in the current institutional
framework for sustainable development.",,
Transnational Governance_Emerging Models of Global Legal Regulation.pdf,"This volume examines the challenges to traditional notions of regulation,
governance and authority posed by the globalisation of economic and social life.
Increasingly, vast financial, technological and corporate processes are eroding
the capacities of national governments to meaningfully regulate society. At the
same time – as the ongoing global financial crisis that erupted in 2007–08 and the
breakdown of the 2009 Copenhagen climate change summit demonstrate – efforts
at international coordination are proving highly problematic.
These developments and crises are themselves, to a significant extent, bound
up with deep-seated changes in economic life. These are, in turn, reflected in shifts
in ideologies and practices of national and international governance in the 1970s
and 1980s. The three planks of the post-Second World War Keynesian Bretton
Woods system – capital controls, demand management and full employment –
have given way to what has been called the ‘Washington Consensus’ system of
free trade, deregulation and ‘shareholder value’. These developments accentuate
the changing ways in which authority and sovereignty can be exercised in such a
globalised political context (Stiglitz 2008). As globalisation continues to extend
and change, it has become increasingly important to understanding the institutional
and transnational means by which nation states and others have attempted to
govern international phenomena such as financialisation, tax evasion, corruption,
terrorism, civil and military conflicts, environmental dangers, social polarisation,
and the challenges in human rights implementation.",,"No changes in the machinery of international law and global governance come
quickly. Wherever states consider the international system as a forum for the
pursuit of domestic foreign policy objectives, little progress is made on initiatives
for creating global public goods. This is borne out clearly in the governance
paralysis in the area of humanitarian intervention as discussed in this chapter. One
can only imagine that, when the locus of power shifts further in the direction of
the populous developing nations of China and India, powers in decline such as
the United States and United Kingdom will regret not using their former power
to establish more democratic and accountable processes for global governance.
In the area of humanitarian intervention, let us hope that it does not take another
Hitler or Stalin to prompt true law reform.",,
Why states act through formal international organizations.pdf,"States use formal international organizations (1Os) to manage both their everyday interactions and more
dramatic episodes, including international conflicts. Yet, contemporary international theory does not explain
the existence or form of 1Os. This article addresses the question of why states use formal organizations by
investigating the functions 1Os perform and the properties that enable them to perform those functions.
Starting with a rational-institutionalist perspective that sees 1Os as enabling states to achieve their ends, the
authors examine power and distributive questions and the role of 1Os in creating norms and understanding.
Centralization and independence are identified as the key properties of formal organizations, and their
importance is illustrated with a wide array of examples. 1Os as community representatives further allow
states to create and implement community values and enforce international commitments.",,"For several decades, states have taken 1Os more seriously than have scholars.
Whereas formal 1Os have been seriously neglected in the theoretical study of interna-
tional regimes, they have played a major role in many, if not most, instances of
interstate collaboration. By taking advantage of the centralization and independence
of 1Os, states are able to achieve goals that they cannot accomplish on a decentralized
basis. In some circumstances, the role of IOs extends even further to include the
development of common norms and practices that help define, or refine, states
themselves. At the same time, because issues of power and distribution are pervasive,
states are wary of allowing IOs too much autonomy. Thus, we do not claim that lOs
are supplanting the states system. We do claim that IOs provide an important supple-
ment to decentralized cooperation that affects the nature and performance of the
international system. Scholars must take 1Os more seriously if they are to understand
interstate relations.
Although we have presented the case for the importance of formal institutions in
international cooperation, the shortcomings of many actual organizations go without
saying. In addition, in emphasizing the possibilities for formal organizations, we
should not ignore the difficulty and even impossibility of some of the tasks that are
presented to them. Despite these severe limitations, the fact that 1Os have not been
abandoned by states is testimony to both their actual value and their perhaps greater
potential. A better theoretical and empirical understanding of formal organizations
should help improve their performance.",,
International Organizations and Implementation. Enforcers_Managers_ Authorities.pdf,,"This edited volume has explored the role that international organizations (IOs)
play in implementation. The observation that states are increasingly delegating
speciﬁc tasks to IOs – namely the translation of international agreements into
laws, regulations, or institutions at the domestic level – led us to pose two main
questions. First, what resources do IOs have at their disposal to ensure that states
follow through on their international commitments, and how effective are these?
Second, how do domestic institutions, actors, and political processes impede or
facilitate the efforts of IOs? For the purposes of this volume, we deﬁned imple-
mentation as a phase of the policy cycle that involves various actors and, unlike
compliance and effectiveness, involves the active mobilization of resources. The
case studies in this volume have generated interesting ﬁndings. They suggest
that IOs not only use their instruments in more varied ways than the literature
suggests, but also that authority plays a much more important role than previ-
ously assumed and that IOs lacking enforcement powers are not necessarily any
less effective than those that do possess them. Moreover, while domestic institu-
tions and opposition from dominant societal or state actors can hamper the
implementation of international agreements, IOs are not entirely powerless in
the face of such obstacles.",,,
International Organizations and the Global Environment_Hannes_Stephan & Zelli - 2007.pdf,,"The organisational network of global environmental governance (GEG) mirrors the complexity of
the planet's manifold and overlapping ecosystems. Bursting onto the international stage in the
1970s, environmental issues began to be addressed by a series of new international organisations,
most of them affiliated with the United Nations. Some of them, such as the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), were given a broad mandate, whereas others like the World
Meteorological Organisation (WMO) concentrated on a much more precise issue-area and have
gained significant authority for their respective sub-fields. After the end of the Cold War, the rise
of international environmental organisations has continued unabated. Yet the new institutions
came to life in an already institutionalised context: some of the urgent tasks of management and
coordination had already been allocated, and the newcomers often contributed to a growing trend
towards organisational fragmentation.
For this chapter, we have adopted a broad and inclusive definition of international
organisation that is nonetheless distinguished from two other types of international institutions,
namely what Keohane (1989: 4) describes as institutions with explicit rules (international
regimes) and institutions with implicit rules (""conventions""). In contrast, the survey by describing a number of well-known global environmental conferences which provided
the seedbed for the steady expansion of international environmental activities.organisations we
study are bureaucratic actors and ""purposive entities"" which are ""capable of monitoring activity
and of reacting to it"" and have been ""deliberately set up and designed by states"" (ibid: 3). They
include not only fully-fledged 'organisations', but also UN commissions and programmes. Among
the plethora of organisations with environment-related activities, we have restricted our analysis
to those operating at the global level and have further selected those with either a clear
environmental profile or a significant impact on global environmental governance.
In addition to our leitmotif of organisational fragmentation – which evokes the image of a
mosaic of institutional elements – we have also taken account of current debates over
mainstreaming and sectoralisation. Thus, many of the organisations reviewed in this chapter
contain indications of the progress made towards a greater cross-sectoral integration of
environmental concerns. For instance, the World Bank or the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) now routinely address environmental factors in their decision-making, albeit
with variable sincerity. Such insights feed into our concluding analysis of future trends and
perspectives for reforming the system of global environmental organisations. We begin our","The international bodies and agencies which have been portrayed in this chapter differ with
regard to several dimensions, including the breadth of their mandate (environmental protection,
sustainable development, or non-environmental issues) as well as their agenda and predominant
policy approach (funding, technical assistance, rule setting or rule enforcement, etc.). Another
distinctive criterion is the position of these organisations with respect to the United Nations; it is
intriguing that – with the exception of the WTO – all of them are somehow linked to the UN
system, albeit in different roles. Hence the observed variety of organisations in global
environmental governance is mostly rooted in the complexity of the UN environmental
machinery which, in turn, ""reflects the complexity and diversity of environmental issues
themselves"" (WRI 2003: 141). This observation notwithstanding, one should not judge this
decentralised arrangement as an inevitable necessity, let alone welcome it as an overtly
harmonious ""symphony"" of organisations (ibid.: 139). For sure, the variety of platforms has
produced numerous benefits, among them: raising awareness and generating information on a
range of environmental problems and policies, mobilising expertise from scientists and NGOs,
providing international negotiating fora, making significant contributions to international
environmental law, and building capacities to implement environmental policies in the
developing world (ibid.: 141ff.).
Yet, on the other hand, the institutional fragmentation implies overlapping mandates and,
more importantly, it entails considerable shortcomings in coordination: more often than not, the
various institutions have restricted cooperation to a well-defined number of issues, and inter-
agency 'turf battles' over competencies and resources are a constant occurrence. Most
prominently, ""other UN bodies have refused to accept UNEP's mandate to coordinate all
environmental activities in the UN system due to ‘institutional seniority.' A number of UNagencies […] possessed environmental responsibilities before UNEP was created and thus feel
less of a need to defer to UNEP"" (Ivanova 2005: 25). Apart from the high transaction costs
arising from such institutional incoherence, this patchwork is not capable of playing the role of a
strong advocate for global environmental concerns vis-à-vis governments or non-environmental
organisations. As a result, the various bodies of the UN environmental machinery have to
compete for scarce contributions from national governments, while failing to convince other
organisations to open their portfolios more extensively for environmental concerns.
Thus, the two ongoing debates on global environmental governance we mentioned at the
outset of this chapter – fragmentation vs. centralisation and sectoralisation vs. mainstreaming –
are clearly interrelated. Merging both discussions has inspired calls for a centralised and cross-
cutting World Sustainable Development Organization, or, with less mainstreaming zeal, for a UN
Environment Organisation – a centralised, but issue-specific authority (Biermann and Bauer
2006). This chapter has implicitly made a similar case, by sketching the strong impact of the
world trade regime on a largely toothless mosaic of environmental institutions and regulations.
However, the section on the WTO has also revealed that creating a centralised counterweight is
no reliable panacea. The WTO itself has repeatedly been dogged by conflict among its member
states, quite similar to the stalemates which keep undermining the coordination among
multilateral environmental organisations. The real difference is the WTO's strong dispute
settlement mechanism which can temporarily circumvent such standstill and exerts an
unprecedented influence on domestic and international policies. Thus, in order to play an
effective role in ""Earth system governance"" (Biermann 2007), a future world environment
organisation would need to be endowed with comparable dispute settlement and enforcement
capacities.
Meanwhile, on a less ambitious but more realistic scale, international environmental
organisations should try to maximise the synergistic potentials of their overlapping tasks. They
could do so through enhanced mainstreaming and division of labour at the project level, and
through bolder cooperation agreements at the organisational level. In addition, striving for cross-
issue package deals among country coalitions might break negotiation impasses within and
between organisations: governments could more actively link environmental issues with non-
environmental concerns – especially with issues of ""high politics"" such as security or trade.
Undoubtedly, such integrative or mainstreaming attempts will have to walk a thin tightrope:
improving inter-organisational coordination while making sure that the environmental component
is not diluted or absorbed by other concerns.",,
International organizations as orchestrators.pdf,"This paper develops a conceptual framework for analyzing IO Orchestration, a governance
approach which is widely used by international organizations (IO) to attain their goals but
hardly analyzed. The paper conceptualizes Orchestration as an indirect and soft mode of
governance to be distinguished from traditional governance by regulation which addresses
the targets of governance directly through hard governance instruments. It also
distinguishes Orchestration from both collaborative governance by self-regulation (which is
soft, but direct) and governance through delegation (which is indirect, but hard).
Accordingly, IOs act as Orchestrators when they enlist intermediary actors on a voluntary
basis by providing them with ideational and material support in order to achieve governance
goals with respect to target actors. Based on this conceptualization, the paper develops a
framework for analyzing the conditions under which IOs rely on Orchestration.",,"This preliminary paper develops and investigates the concept of orchestration as a soft and
indirect form of governance. While it can be used by many different actors, orchestration is
especially valuable for actors who lack traditional “regulatory” powers, with IOs providing a
leading example. Indeed, our identification of the concept was inspired by our earlier
separate work on IOs, and our elaboration of the concept is an effort to distill what we
believe we have observed in those settings. Although we have presented hypotheses
regarding why IOs will use orchestration for what sorts of issues and under what sorts of
circumstances, our evidence at this point only takes the form of plausible illustrations. Nevertheless, we suspect that when the characteristics described in the hypotheses of table
3 come together, IO orchestration is a highly likely result. In any case, we welcome
suggestion of other cases where IOs do or do not use orchestration, as well as reactions as to
whether the concept of orchestration seems useful for thinking about IO governance and to
whether we have identified the conditions that are most relevant for IO orchestration.
If orchestration matters, it is potentially a valuable addition to both research and policy. On
the research side, it helps expand our understanding of how “weak” institutions like IOs can
have an impact on international governance and of the interrelations among actors in multi-
stakeholder arrangements. On the policy side, orchestration opens up new strategies for
improving the performance of IOs, and potentially of other orchestrators.
The fact that orchestration is a relatively new and still developing form of governance at the
international level has two immediate implications. One is that the available evidence is
biased against our hypotheses (even if these conjectures are correct) in the sense that IOs
may not yet be using orchestration in areas (and for reasons) where it would be valuable to
them. Nevertheless, the hypotheses should point towards the relative frequency of
orchestration across different circumstance even if it is not used as intensively in some areas
as it should be. Moreover, the empirical case studies in this project should not only illustrate
the use (or not) of orchestration in different areas but also provide evidence on the
development and effectiveness (if any) of orchestration over time.
A related implication is that our discussion of orchestration is normative as well as positive.
It is normative in that we are as much making a case for why IOs should use orchestration
under certain circumstances as demonstrating that some of them actually do so at this point
in time. In particular, if the positive side of this project shows that a number of IOs are using
orchestration effectively then that supports our normative presumption that other IOs in
comparable circumstances should do so as well. However, our tentative enthusiasm for
orchestration implicitly assumes that IOs will orchestrate to good ends. We recognize, of
course, that IOs are subject to various organizational pathologies that may prevent them
from orchestrating or cause them to orchestrate less than desirable policies. Regardless,
major differences exist among relevant stakeholders (IOs, states, civil society) about what
goals to pursue if they do orchestrate. While such choices are necessarily political and
controversial, we nevertheless see orchestration as holding the potential to be harnessed to
good ends however those are defined.
Other limitations of orchestration should be noted too. First, orchestration is an especially
important strategy for IOs that lack the material and enforcement capacities necessary for
stronger forms of regulation. Thus even if orchestration is potentially quite effective, it may
still represent a second-best solution as compared to the traditional (but in many
circumstances unavailable) ideal. Second, insofar as orchestration enhances the capability of
IOs, it raises corresponding questions about their accountability, like those raised in the
“democratic deficit” debate. However, any evaluation of this deficit should be conducted in terms not only of a democratic ideal, but also in comparison with the realistic alternatives,
including traditional IO operations, the failure of international cooperation, or of the
imposition of rules by powerful states. Third, orchestration does not change the
fundamental fact that states have much greater material capacity than IOs, as well as
ultimate authority over IOs. Orchestration provides a way for IOs to pursue collective goals –
of states, of non-state actors and of IOs – at lower sovereignty costs to states; it also allows
IOs to engage non-state in ways that may shift the goals of states or change their domestic
political constraints over time. The ultimate glue that holds orchestrated arrangements
together is the common interest created by globalization and the needs shared by states, IOs
and other actors to cooperate in managing their changing environment. That said,
orchestration is thus far only a modest change in the allocation of authority in the
international system.",,

International Organizations- The Politics and Processes of Global Governance.pdf,"Growing evidence of climate change, along with the
continuing threat of global terrorism, pandemics, the resurgence of eth-
nonationalism, and memories of the meltdown of financial markets in 2008,
has brought home to people around the world the complex problems we
face today. These also include the dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation,
large-scale humanitarian crises and intractable conflicts in Africa and the
Middle East, the persistence of deep poverty, the continuing growth of
international migration both legal and illegal, and failed states.
None of these problems can be solved by sovereign states acting alone.
All require cooperation of some sort among states and the growing number
of nonstate actors; many require the active participation of ordinary citi-
zens; some demand the establishment of new international mechanisms for
monitoring or the negotiation of new international rules; and most require
the refinement of means for securing states’ and other actors’ compliance.
Many contemporary problems are also requiring new types of partner-
ships—some between existing organizations such as the United Nations
(UN) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Libya or the
African Union (AU) in Somalia; others involve public-private partnerships
such as between the UN and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to
address various international health issues. In short, there is a wide variety
of cross-border issues and problems that require governance. Sometimes
the need is truly global in scope, as with pandemics or climate change. In
other cases, the governance problem is specific to a region of the world or
group of countries, as with the need to manage an international river or
regional sea. Sometimes, a problem cannot be neatly classified, as with the
Arctic, where the nexus of issues posed by climate change affects not just
states and peoples but significant parts of the world. As Bruce Jentleson
(2012: 145) has noted, “The need for global governance is not an if ques-
tion. It is a how question.” But what do we mean by “global governance,”
and why is the need for it increasing?",,,,
International Organizations under Pressure_Legitimating Global Governance in Challenging Times.pdf,"In this book, we document how the list of normative expectations that
international organizations confront has become longer and more heteroge-
neous over time. Today, international organizations are not only expected to
serve their member states, but also advance the interests of the individuals and
communities in these states. In addition, international organizations are not
only evaluated based on what they accomplish, but also based on the ways in
which they organize their work and manage themselves. Taken together, the
combined rise of ‘people-based’ and of ‘procedural’ legitimacy standards, we
argue, makes the legitimation of international organizations more challenging,
notably because traditional norms remain in place while new norms are added
to the menu.",,,,
International regulation without international government- Improving IO performance through orchestration_Abott&Snidar.pdf,"nternational organizations (IOs) have been widely criticized as ineffective. Yet
scholars and practitioners assessing IO performance frequently focus on traditional modes
of governance such as treaties and inter-state dispute-resolution mechanisms. When they
observe poor performance, moreover, they often prescribe a strengthening of those same
activities. We call this reliance on traditional state-based mechanisms “International Old
Governance” (IOG). A better way to understand and improve IO performance is to
consider the full range of ways in which IOs can and do operate—including, increasingly,
by reaching out to private actors and institutions, collaborating with them, and supporting
and shaping their activities. Such actions are helping to develop an intricate global
network of public, private and mixed institutions and norms, partially orchestrated by IOs,
that we call “Transnational New Governance” (TNG). With proper orchestration by IOs,
TNG can ameliorate both “state failure”—the inadequacies of IOG—and “market
failure”—the problems that result when the creation and evolution of norm-setting
institutions is highly decentralized. Orchestration thus provides a significant way for IOs
to improve their regulatory performance. Some IOs already engage actively with private
actors and institutions—we provide a range of illustrations, highlighting the activities of
the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Yet there remains a significant “orchestration
deficit” that provides real opportunities for IOs. We draw on the lessons of existing IO
activities to suggest additional possibilities for improving IO performance.",,"IOs have been broadly criticized as ineffective. The traditional IOG approaches pursued
by most IOs are especially ill-suited for addressing many issues raised by contemporary
globalization—such as the social and environmental impacts of transnational
corporations—which turn predominantly on the behavior of private actors. However,
the emergence of a wide variety of RSS schemes—private, public and mixed—opens
new possibilities for international governance and new potential roles for IOs, which are
only beginning to be explored. While IO orchestration of the emerging TNG system
offers no panacea, it does offer exciting new opportunities to improve IO performance.
Working with private partners allows IOs to expand their available capacities and
resources; it also diversifies away from their reliance on states. At the same time, such
interactions can stimulate IOs to learn and adapt, offsetting some of their bureaucratic
pathologies. To take advantage of these opportunities, however, IOs must become more
proactive in facilitative and directive orchestration. None of this is to downplay the
difficulties IOs face. The scope of problems being addressed is immense, and IOs have
relatively limited capacities; the orchestration deficit is real even if it is significantly
smaller than the IOG deficit. Given these circumstances, IO orchestration offers a
promising addition to the repertoire of IOs that may improve their performance over a
large and growing area of international regulation.
IOs have a special place in TNG because of the nature of the underlying regulatory
issues and the limitations of decentralized RSS. Individual RSS schemes sometimes
work at cross-purposes, and satisfactory schemes have not emerged in all the areas
where they could be beneficial. Only IOs have the global reach, representativeness and
legitimacy to orchestrate a successful TNG system. A few IOs—such as UNEP and the
UN Secretary-General’s office—have pioneered such approaches, but many others have
not yet risen to the challenge. There is enormous potential to broaden and deepen IO
engagement. This is the challenge and the opportunity for IOs: to improve their
performance through orchestration.",,

as global bodies who acquired some degree of independence from national public policies. As
opposed to their nongovernmental counterparts, this class of international agencies has been
established by nation states that have agreed upon a formal mandate for the international orga-
nization that grants most of them legal status and basic funding. They can be characterized as a
hierarchically organized group of international civil servants with collective resources,

a focus on international environmental policy. Learning and change within
eight international bodies was analyzed on the basis of organizational theory
and principal-agent theory. This combined approach provided an encompass-
ing explanatory tool for the learning processes observed. While some patterns
within international organizations seem speciªc to the organizations studied
and the ªeld of international environmental policy, the study also allows for
some general conclusions.
First, intergovernmental organizations in environmental policy can gener-
ate knowledge and learn on an organizational level. However, forms and out-
comes of organizational learning processes differ. The data presented here re-
veals organizations engaged in reºexive learning, adaptive learning, and no
learning. While reºexive learning tended to induce fundamental changes in or-
ganizational structures and their practices, adaptive learning brought the orga-
nization in line with the demands of external stakeholders and induced only
minor changes inside the organization itself. One can expect to ªnd this varia-
tion in the types of learning in other international organizations as well.
Second, an organization’s polity sets out the landscape for possible learnng processes. Multi-issue organizations with a wide mandate have some leeway
to embark on reºexive learning involving reconsideration of their purpose and
the targets to be pursued. Single-issue organizations with a narrow mandate will
more often be restricted to adaptive learning if they learn at all. Moreover, the
degree of independence from principals seems of importance in the case of in-
ternational organizations. Since national governments and in some cases also
NGOs play important roles for intergovernmental organizations, some leeway
to learn and change direction on the side of the organization seems necessary
for reºexive learning to occur. They need to have enough formal or informal au-
tonomy from external actors such as national governments to act and to acquire
and pursue knowledge independently. This relationship between national gov-
ernments as strong principals and the organizations as agents seems to be a dis-
tinctive feature of intergovernmental organizations. National governments as
the principals of international organizations can restrict the organization’s au-
tonomy and thereby its scope for learning. The absence of their direct inºuence
often allows internal forces to promote particular learning processes.
Third, any form of learning, be it adaptive learning or reºexive learning,
necessitates learning mechanisms as means to acquire and generate new knowl-
edge. These mechanisms have tended to be used as a means to identify and im-
plement solutions to organizational problems. In particular, mechanisms that
incorporate independent, external knowledge seem to be better prepared to trig-
ger adaptive or reºexive learning than those that close off the organization
against such knowledge. Reºexive learning, however, requires that external and
internal knowledge bases are integrated and that principals grant the organiza-
tion sufªcient authority to establish and respond to learning mechanisms.
Fourth, reºexive learning necessitates an independent leader who is also
willing and able to act as a change agent. This ªnding emphasizes the common
call for change agents with executive powers in the organizational learning liter-
ature. 67 In particular, it stresses the need for leadership qualities to promote
reºexive learning.
Fifth, adaptive learning appears to be triggered by external pressures either
from national governments and/or NGOs or other international organizations.
While adaptive learning in business ªrms is not bound to external pressures, in
the international organizations in this study, all adaptive learning occurred in
response to external demands and pressures. This ªnding only partly conªrms
claims from principal-agent theory. Pressure from principals is a relevant factor
also for internal learning processes, but it hardly sufªces for an explanation of
the processes observed in these cases. Most learning processes develop their
own dynamics and result from the interaction of internal and external factors
with national governments as only one group of relevant stakeholders.",,
Moving forward by looking back_Learning from UNEP’s history.pdf,"With a growing recognition that global problems demand global solutions,
governments have created an increasingly complex network of
international environmental treaties and organizations to deal with
environmental challenges. 1 Yet, international environmental problems
persist unabated and are even increasing in scale and scope, attesting that
our first attempt at global environmental governance has been “an
experiment that has largely failed.” 2 Short-term economic considerations
and sovereignty concerns have often overridden the political will to
effectively combat environmental problems. The institutions created have
been weak and “woefully inadequate to meet global environmental
challenges.” 3 Some analysts even argue that the system was deliberately
designed to be ineffective. 4
Careful analysis of archival materials, however, shows that the system
for global environmental governance and the organization at its core - the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - were not the product
of malicious intent. UNEP was not purposefully established as a “weak,
underfunded, overloaded, and remote organization.” 5 Rather, it was
created as the “anchor institution” for the global environment 6 to serve as
the world’s ecological conscience, to provide impartial monitoring and
assessment, to serve as a global source of information on the
environment, to “speed up international action on urgent environmental
problems,” and to “stimulate further international agreements of a
regulatory character.” 7 Most importantly, the mission of the new
environment Programme was to ensure coherent collective environmental
efforts by providing central leadership, assuring a comprehensive and
integrated overview of environmental problems and developing stronger
linkages among environmental institutions and the constituencies they serve. 8 While UNEP’s performance has been significantly affected by the
early design choices, this has been the result of predictable but unintended
consequences. This historical understanding opens a new line of analysis
in the context of current UN environmental reform. If the system was not
deliberately designed as ineffective, change in course becomes possible
and even practical.
The analysis in this chapter shows the origins of the institutional
design of the United Nations Environment Programme providing a
factual account of key historical decisions that the architects of the global
environmental governance system made in 1972 and straightens the
record of global environmental governance. The analysis proceeds in two
analytical steps. First, the political context within which the Stockholm
Conference of 1972 took place is examined. Second, the article explains
the decisions on the functions, form, and financing of the new
intergovernmental body for the environment. It traces the historical roots
and motivations behind these choices and shows the lack of evidence as
to purposeful intent on the part of states to create a weak institution
within the United Nations.
These historical dynamics carry implications for the contemporary
international environmental governance reform process. As today’s
architects of reform seek to improve the complex system of global
environmental governance, they face the task of rethinking how to
restructure existing institutions and organizations for global collective
action in the environmental field. In the context of current reform efforts,
the North and the South are no longer at the two opposite ends of the
spectrum. In February 2007, forty-six countries supported the upgrade of
the United Nations Environment Programme to a United Nations
Environment Organization (UNEO) and a “Friends of the UNEO”
group was established comprised of developed and developing countries
alike (See Appendix II). Without solid understanding of past and present
interests and positions of the actors in global environmental governance,
critical choices are likely to be made based on faulty assumptions and
might lead to unintended but serious consequences.",,,,
