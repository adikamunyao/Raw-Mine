    "<p>The goal was to create a function that extracts and categorizes spatial jurisdictional information from textual descriptions of various organizations. These spatial jurisdictional descriptions can vary widely in terms of geographical boundaries, political/economic zones. The challenge was to design a system that can interpret these often complex and nuanced descriptions and provide a clear and concise summary of the spatial jurisdictional scope of each organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, I developed a function that would scan the text for jurisdiction-related keywords and categorize the results accordingly. The function was designed to identify terms related to geographical coverage, maritime zones, member states, environmental factors, and areas of cooperation. The first challenge was to ensure that the function could extract jurisdictional terms such as `global,` `territorial seas,` and `EEZ` (Exclusive Economic Zones) effectively, even when these terms were used with slight variations or in different contexts.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Handling Case Sensitivity**\n",
    "To address case insensitivity, I standardized the jurisdiction text by converting it to lowercase before performing keyword matching. This preprocessing step ensured that the function could match jurisdictional terms regardless of whether they were capitalized, thus improving the accuracy of the keyword matching process. Terms like `territorial seas,` `territorial Seas,` or `TERRITORIAL SEAS` were all captured, ensuring no relevant jurisdictional reference was overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expanding Keyword Matching for Jurisdictional Types**\n",
    "To enhance the functionâ€™s ability to identify various jurisdictional references, I expanded the list of keywords. For example, in addition to terms like \"global\" and \"worldwide\" for global jurisdiction, I added variations like `international` and `across all countries.` Similarly, the keywords for maritime jurisdiction were expanded to include not only \"Exclusive Economic Zones\" but also \"EEZ,\" `territorial seas,` and related maritime zones. This expansion allowed the function to recognize jurisdictional references in multiple formats, making it more robust when handling different descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Addressing Ambiguous or Undefined Jurisdictions**\n",
    "<p>One of the challenges was handling ambiguous jurisdictional descriptions or cases where an organization did not exercise clear authority over a specific geographical area. For example, the UNCTAD Secretariat operates globally but does not specify jurisdiction over particular maritime zones or distances from coastlines. To account for such cases, I added checks for phrases like `not limited to a specific geographical area` and `does not have authority over,` ensuring the system correctly categorized these cases as `no specific jurisdiction` or `undefined jurisdiction.` This made the function more versatile and accurate in handling organizations with a broad or undefined mandate.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Incorporating International and Environmental Jurisdictions**\n",
    "The function was also enhanced to detect more specialized jurisdictional references. For example, I included terms related to the international seabed, such as `beyond national jurisdiction` and `seabed beyond national jurisdiction.` This allowed the system to recognize descriptions referencing global environmental issues, such as `climate change,` `weather,` and `atmosphere,` as part of a global environmental jurisdiction. Additionally, I incorporated keywords related to environmental governance, ensuring that these specific jurisdictions were captured."
