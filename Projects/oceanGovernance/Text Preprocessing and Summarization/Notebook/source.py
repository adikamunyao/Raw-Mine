The UNCCD Secretariat derives its mandate from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), 
which established the UNCCD as a legally binding framework to address desertification and the effects of drought.
Article 23 of the Convention defines the functions and location of the Secretariat. Article 22 establishes modalities 
for the Conference of Parties, and Articles 20-21 outline the financial resources and funding mechanism of the Secretariat.
Additionally, the UNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework, adopted by the Conference of the Parties (COP) in 2017, specifies 
the vision, mission, strategic objectives, and expected impacts of the UNCCD for the period 2018-2030.
