# Data Skills Showcase: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights

Welcome to my repository demonstrating a comprehensive data science workflow! This project highlights my expertise in transforming raw, unstructured data into meaningful insights through data mining, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Designed as a private client deliverable, this repo keeps specifics confidential but showcases my technical skills and process—perfect for anyone looking to see my capabilities in action.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Mining**: Extracted and processed raw text data into structured formats.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed pattern recognition, summarization, and cross-sectional analysis.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive, intuitive visuals with D3.js.
- **Machine Learning**: Applied predictive modeling to enhance insights (simulated example included).

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Mining & Cleaning
- **Task**: Started with raw text data (e.g., unstructured logs or reports).
- **Process**: 
  - Parsed text using Python, converting categorical entries to numerical values (e.g., binary encoding).
  - Cleaned inconsistencies—standardized formats, removed noise, and structured into a dataset.
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy).
- **Output**: A clean CSV ready for analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis
- **Task**: Dug into the data to find trends and patterns.
- **Process**: 
  - Aggregated counts and grouped by key categories (e.g., time periods, types).
  - Identified commonalities and differences across data segments.
  - Synthesized findings into actionable summaries.
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, SciPy).
- **Output**: A summarized dataset with key metrics.

### 3. Visualization
- **Task**: Turned numbers into clear, engaging visuals.
- **Process**: 
  - Built 5 interactive plots with D3.js:
    - Bar Chart: Showed feature counts.
    - Stacked Bar: Compared group differences.
    - Line Graph: Tracked trends over time.
    - Heatmap: Mapped distribution across entities.
    - Radar Chart: Profiled categories over time.
- **Tools**: D3.js, JavaScript.
- **Output**: HTML files with visuals (`visuals/` folder).

### 4. Machine Learning
- **Task**: Added predictive power to the analysis.
- **Process**: 
  - Simulated a model (e.g., Random Forest) on a sample dataset to predict feature presence.
  - Evaluated with accuracy metrics (e.g., 85% accuracy on sample).
- **Tools**: Python (Scikit-learn).
- **Output**: A demo script (`ml_example.py`) showing ML application.
